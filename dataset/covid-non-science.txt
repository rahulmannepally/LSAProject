COVID recovery vs COVID reality

LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - World shares inched towards a four-month high on Friday and industrial bellwether metal copper was set for its longest weekly winning streak in nearly three years, as recovering global data kept nagging coronavirus nerves at bay.

The market rally fuelled by record U.S. jobs numbers had largely blown itself amid a spike in U.S. COVID cases, though the fastest expansion in China's services sector in over a decade and more stimulus ensured optimism remained.

Chinese shares had charged to their highest level in five years , helping the pan-Asian indexes to 4-month peaks, so the sight of European markets stalling early on took some traders by surprise.

Currency and commodity markets also had a subdued feel after an otherwise strong week for confidence-sensitive stalwarts such oil, copper, sterling and the Australian dollar, which all struggled on Friday.

"I think infection rates and fears of localised lockdowns have doused some of the enthusiasm," said Societe Generale strategist Kit Jukes.

"We have three elements now; vaccine hopes, decent data in most places but also the return of infection rates which can make you nervous."

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose slightly in early London trading. It was up less than 0.1% at 97.306 and still firmly on track for its biggest weekly fall since the first week of June.

The euro was down at $1.1226 and though it gained against the safe Swiss franc it fell versus the sometimes commodity-driven Norwegian crown.

S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2% but volumes were lower than usual due to a U.S. markets holiday on Friday for Independence Day.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 4.8 million jobs in June, above the average forecast of 3 million jobs in June, thanks to rises in the hard-hit hospitality sectors.

But economists noted there were caveats to the upbeat headline figures.

The number of permanent job losers continued to rise, increasing by 588,000 to 2.9 million in June while the unemployment rate remains a chunky 7.6 percentage points above its February level. A Deutsche Bank analysis put the U.S. unemployment rate behind all its developed market peers barring Canada.

The recovery also faces more headwinds as a surge of new coronavirus infections prompts U.S. states to delay and in some cases reverse plans to let stores reopen and activities resume.

More than three dozen U.S. states saw increases in COVID-19 cases, with cases in Florida spiking above 10,000.

Nevertheless markets are largely overlooking the spikes, taking the view that overall the situation was still improving overall.

Ten-year German government bond yields are up 5 basis points this week and set for their biggest weekly rise in a month, though they nudged down on Friday to -0.44%. Riskier Italian yields fell to 1.26% as well though, which is their lowest since late March.

Oil prices also eased after an otherwise solid week. Brent crude fell 0.65% to $42.86 a barrel while U.S. crude dropped 0.66% to $40.38 a barrel. Both were around $25 this time two months ago.

Copper prices were poised for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, their longest winning streak in nearly three years, despite a slight easing on the day after top supplier Chile had assured traders about supply.

Three-month LME copper was hovering at $6,040 a tonne, more than $1,500 up from lows it ploughed to in March.

"The one issue that hangs over all the markets is will we see a surge in secondary infections that will trigger a second wave of national rather than regional shutdowns?" Malcolm Freeman, director of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note.

Covid-19 Antivirals Taskforce launched
By PA MEDIA

PUBLISHED: 17:04, 20 April 2021 | UPDATED: 19:08, 20 April 2021
At-home Covid-19 treatments are being sought by a team of Government experts to speed up recovery time for people who become infected with the virus.

The Government has set up a new taskforce to “supercharge” the search for antiviral medications for Covid-19.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the group will seek out new medicines to “stop Covid-19 in its tracks”.

It is hoped that antivirals could help to reduce infections and limit the impact of any new variants.

They may also help to protect people who cannot take vaccines or those who are not fully protected after having the jab.

Officials hope to find and bring two treatments online this year.

This could mean that people with Covid-19, or those they have been in close contact with, could be offered antiviral medication – offered in tablet form – to stop the infection spreading and speed up recovery time.

The new Antivirals Taskforce, which is yet to appoint a chair, will search for the most promising potential antiviral medicines which can be taken at home.

The taskforce will support the development of the drugs through clinical trials and also look at manufacturing opportunities.

Antiviral drugs are a type of medication used specifically for treating viral infections, and act by killing or preventing the growth of viruses.

“The success of our vaccination programme has demonstrated what the UK can achieve when we bring together our brightest minds,” said Mr Johnson.

“Our new Antivirals Taskforce will seek to develop innovative treatments you can take at home to stop Covid-19 in its tracks.

“These could provide another vital defence against any future increase in infections and save more lives.”

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Medicines are a vital weapon to protect our loved ones from this terrible virus.

“Modelled on the success of the vaccines and therapeutics taskforces, which have played a crucial part in our response to the pandemic, we are now bringing together a new team that will supercharge the search for antiviral treatments and roll them out as soon as the autumn.”

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: “The speed at which vaccines and therapeutics such as dexamethasone have been identified and deployed against Covid-19 has been critical to the pandemic response.

“Antivirals in tablet form are another key tool for the response.

“They could help protect those not protected by or ineligible for vaccines.

“They could also be another layer of defence in the face of new variants of concern.”

Dr Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said: “The NHS has put research into reality at record speed during the pandemic and this taskforce will now help us to identify and roll out even more new, convenient treatments for patients with Covid-19.”

Commenting on the announcement, Dr Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at Kings College London, said: “Antiviral treatment of influenza has been shown to reduce hospitalisation and prevent death in epidemic and pandemic waves and a similar, preferably simple to use antiviral, suitable for use in the community can add to the range of interventions critical to enable us to remain on top of the Covid pandemic even in the event of the emergence of viral variants insensitive to vaccines.”

She said that there are a number of early phase trials looking at oral antiviral medications.

African Covid deaths top 100,000
By AFP

PUBLISHED: 19:32, 18 February 2021 | UPDATED: 19:32, 18 February 2021

Africa on Thursday recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, a grim milestone likely to understate the real toll, as the continent of 1.2 billion people battles a second wave of infections.

The 54 countries in the region have a death toll of 100,000 from 3,793,660 reported cases, according to an AFP tally.

The continent, relatively spared by the pandemic, is the last except Oceania to reach the threshold of 100,000 deaths, which Europe crossed in April 2020.

South Africa -- the worst hit African country -- rolled out a mass testing campaign at the start of the pandemic.

To date, the country has recorded nearly 1.5 million cases and more than 48,000 deaths.

But those figures, based on daily reports communicated by health authorities, only reflect a fraction of the actual case load, health specialists say.

"The cases are clearly under-reported because of poor access to healthcare facilities and under-reporting of milder cases," South African virologist Barry Schoub, also a member of the Scientific Council at the South African Ministry of Health told AFP.

Understaffed health facilities and lack of means have meant many African countries have been unable to do mass testing.

"Many countries have mainly PCR tests in the capitals. And the further one moves away from the urban centres, the less there are tests," explained French epidemiologist Emmanuel Baron from Doctors Without Borders.

"It is a disease that can go unnoticed with asymptomatic patients, or with symptoms that can be confused with others," he added.

- Covid found in pawpaw -

In Zimbabwe, a country with a devastated economy and mismanaged health system, hospitals are filled with Covid patients, exhausted doctors and overwhelmed nurses. But the official number of cases remains low.

Tanzania stopped testing in May 2020 after claiming it had found a positive Covid case in a pawpaw, a quail and even a goat. The Tanzanian government last released official figures in April.

"If someone had told me a year ago that we, as a continent, would see 100,000 deaths from this infection, I probably would not have believed it," John Nkengasong, the Africa Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), told reporters on Thursday.

The toll in Africa is, however, significantly lower than in Europe, the world´s most affected region, with 818,912 deaths recorded so far. The other regions that are badly hit are Latin America with 649,006 deaths and the United States and Canada 512,295 deaths.

After a sharp increase in January, Africa´s figures have fallen sharply in the past few weeks. Over the last seven days, the continent recorded 3,054 deaths, a drop of 18 percent from the previous week.

At the height of the pandemic in January, the continent had 906 deaths per day.

- No disaster -

While coronavirus figures are clearly underestimated, "we have not seen a health disaster in Africa to date", said Baron.

Several studies on antibodies, which make it possible to detect whether a person who is recovered has previously been exposed to the virus, are underway in many African countries and should provide a better idea of the impact of the pandemic in the region.

South Africa, where almost all of the latest cases are attributed to a variant of the virus known to be more contagious and which has spread widely, represents nearly half of the deaths and reported cases on the continent.

The other African countries that are most affected are Egypt (10,150 deaths from 175,677 cases) and Morocco (8,524 deaths from 480,056 cases).

South Africa is also the country with most Covid-19 fatalities on the continent, counting 82 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, ahead of Tunisia (65 deaths) and Eswatini (55).

Lagging behind in the vaccination race, the continent's leading industrial powerhouse administered its first vaccines on Wednesday.

Globally, Covid-19 has caused more than 109 million infections and over 2.4 million deaths since the start of the epidemic in Wuhan in China in December 2019.

Gyms aren't COVID hotspots: industry
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 01:56, 13 August 2020 | UPDATED: 01:56, 13 August 2020

The fitness industry has hit back at the perception that gyms are COVID-19 hotspots, saying there has been no transmission of the virus linked to gyms.

Fitness Australia chief executive Barrie Elvish said Fitness Australia has gathered data from a random sample of NSW operators that proves gyms are safe.

Since gyms reopened on June 13, there had been more than 6.26 million visits to 423 NSW gyms, with no recorded community transmission, he said.

"The same cannot be said for restaurants or bars in NSW where cluster cases have started and spread. However, gyms are still being categorised with these and other entertainment venues and cast in a negative light," he said in a statement on Thursday.

However, misinformation and negative commentary portrayed health and fitness facilities as "hotspots" for COVID-19, resulting in some people being too scared to exercise at their gym, he said, despite additional precautions and stringent hygiene practices.

The Fitness Australia data was gathered from electronic swipes, used by members for access, which also could be used for sophisticated contact tracing should it be required.

Mr Elvish said there had been 13 reported cases in NSW where a member had visited the gym while infected with COVID-19 but health authorities had not identified any cases of transmission in a gym.

"We are not part of the problem. We are actually part of the solution to getting more Australians more active more often and help prevent long-term lifestyle-related disease," Mr Elvish said.

"We are urging the government to work with Fitness Australia, and the industry, to ensure the health and safety of the community."

COVID-19 victims maintain immunity
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 20:23, 22 November 2020 | UPDATED: 20:23, 22 November 2020

Australian researchers have discovered that patients who've been infected with COVID-19 retain immunity against the virus and the disease for at least eight months.

The research is the strongest evidence yet that vaccines against the virus will work for long periods.

Previous studies found the first wave of antibodies produced by the human body after infection waned after the first few months, raising concerns that people could quickly lose immunity.

The new research allays those concerns.

The study is the result of a collaboration led by Associate Professor Menno van Zelm, from Monash University and was published on Monday in the preprint server, MedRxiv.

The researchers found a specific cell within the human immune system, the memory B cell, "remembers" infection by the virus, and if challenged again, through re-exposure to the virus, triggers a protective immune response through rapid production of protective antibodies.

The researchers recruited 25 COVID-19 patients and took 36 blood samples between day four post-infection and day 242 post-infection.

As with other studies, looking at the antibody response, the researchers found that antibodies against the virus started to drop off after 20 days post-infection.

However, all patients continued to have memory B cells that recognised one of two components of the virus, the spike and nucleocapsid proteins.

These virus-specific memory B cells were present as long as eight months after infection.

Associate Professor van Zelm said the results gave hope to the efficacy of any vaccine against the virus and explained why there had been so few examples of genuine reinfection in the millions of people who had tested positive for the virus globally.

"These results are important because they show, definitively, that patients infected with the COVID-19 virus do in fact retain immunity against the virus and the disease," he said.

"This has been a black cloud hanging over the potential protection that could be provided by any COVID-19 vaccine and gives real hope that, once a vaccine or vaccines are developed, they will provide long-term protection."

The origins of COVID-19
By REUTERS

PUBLISHED: 03:30, 19 January 2021 | UPDATED: 03:45, 19 January 2021

SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - As a team from the World Health Organization works in China to investigate the origins of COVID-19, the following factbox looks at what we know about how the pandemic began.

CHINA ORIGINS

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 - known as SARS-CoV-2 - was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in January 2020, and most scientists believe it is still most likely that it originated in China.

Peter Ben Embarek, WHO expert on food safety and zoonotic diseases, said Wuhan offered "the first solid clues" about the transmission of COVID-19 and any investigation would start there.

Though some studies have suggested COVID-19 was present in Italy or Spain earlier in 2019, and that it might have been responsible for a spike in pneumonia cases in France, few researchers believe it could have entered Wuhan from Europe.

Its closest relative in nature is the RaTG13 virus, which was discovered in horseshoe bats in southwest China's Yunnan province. The 96.2% genetic match between the two makes it highly likely that COVID-19 also originated in the bat colonies of China's southwest border regions.

HUANAN MARKET

The initial cluster of infections was traced back to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, leading many to assume that "patient zero" was probably a trader exposed to contaminated meat products.

But this version of events may be too simplistic to explain the patterns of infection in Wuhan and elsewhere.

Many of the earliest reported cases had no connection with the market. On Dec. 10, 2019, 41 Wuhan residents were hospitalised with what turned out to be COVID-19, but 13 of them had no link to Huanan.

A team of Chinese researchers said there were two types of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Wuhan, only one of which was associated with the market.

Scientists also said the virus was unusually "pre-adapted" for rapid human transmission, making it unlikely that the first human contact was made at the seafood market.

INTERMEDIARY SPECIES?

WHO investigators are keen to find what the intermediary species was that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to move from its original bat host into humans.

Preliminary scientific papers in China identified snakes and mink as potential candidates, and similar coronavirus infections were also found in pangolins illegally trafficked into China.

But some scholars now believe there was no intermediary species at all, and that a SARS-CoV-2 like virus was transmitted directly from bats to humans, possibly on multiple occasions.

The first people infected were likely to be traders in bat meat, or in bat droppings used in traditional Chinese medicine, and one of them could have carried it into the Huanan seafood market, causing the superspreader event that allowed the pandemic to begin.

"GAIN OF FUNCTION"

Though there is no credible supporting evidence, some researchers still do not rule out the possibility that the virus was released accidentally by a specialist lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

There is no indication that SARS-Cov-2 contains any synthetic insertions, but some researchers say it could have been subject to a process known as "gain of function", where the lab forces the virus to become more infectious by exposing it to human receptor cells.

Some experts say the WHO investigators needs to be granted access to all the research conducted in the lab to see whether there are any closer matches than the RaTG13 virus.

But there is another explanation why the coronavirus has proven to be so lethal.

If SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating in humans throughout southwest China for months before it was finally identified in Wuhan, natural selection itself could have trained it to bind more effectively to those receptor cells.

Fully optimised after months of human exposure, it made an explosive breakthrough at the Huanan market, where conditions were ideal for rapid viral transmission - though it was also very likely spreading elsewhere. (Reporting by David Stanway. Editing by Gerry Doyle)

Auckland removes all COVID restrictions
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 22:49, 11 March 2021 | UPDATED: 23:24, 11 March 2021

New Zealand has downscaled COVID-19 alert levels in Auckland, marking the end of restrictions from the Valentine's Day outbreak.

However, Jacinda Ardern's government has been criticised for making the decision on Thursday and delaying the announcement.

First bloke Clarke Gayford jumped the gun on the prime minister, tweeting the government's decision four hours before Ms Ardern's scheduled press conference.

"An inprinciple (sic) decision was decided but its (sic) all pending on final test results today," he wrote, in response to criticism from Kiwi chef Martin Bosley.

"Feeling really sorry for all Auckland Hospo having to wait until 11.30am today to find out about moving levels. It's utterly ludicrous. Stay strong, my friends," Mr Bosley said.

Aucklanders were expecting the shift as there have been no community cases for a fortnight.

At 11:30am, Ms Ardern announced NZ's biggest city would move from alert level two to alert level one as of 12noon.

"Once again the city stepped up and did what it needed to do ... for that we say thank you," she said.

"Look after each other and enjoy your weekend."

The decision allows for crowds to gather to watch America's Cup sailing, the Auckland Cup racing meet on Saturday, and for postponed Auckland Pride events.

Business and hospitality figures attacked the decision, saying it did not allow them enough time to change staffing and order supplies for a bumper Friday night's trade.

Auckland Pride director Max Tweedie said the wait was "frustrating".

"The sector had anticipated a move at 11:59 tonight, which now changes everything for Friday night shows & events," he said.

"We need time to roll out plans, release tickets, change seating/signage. We didn't get it."

Opposition leader Judith Collins called the PM's communications "not good enough".

Ms Ardern said cabinet met on Thursday afternoon and decided to move alert levels, pending any new cases and testing of close contacts - information that was due on Friday morning.

Ms Ardern rejected the notion Mr Gayford's tweet was improper.

"I have not seen my partner since yesterday and I really reject the implication," she said.

"He has not known the decision. He's known the process which is exactly what Ministers have conveyed in the public domain."

The Valentine's Day outbreak, first identified on February 14, prompted the government into two lockdowns of New Zealand's biggest city.

The first was a three-day lockdown beginning February 15.

A week-long lockdown began on February 28 when a new community case was identified without links to the cluster, but was subsequently traced back to the outbreak.

In total, 15 people have tested positive to COVID-19 from the latest outbreak. Health officials are yet to discover its origin.

Feb 22 (Reuters) - Britain, whose economy has been among the hardest hit in Europe by the COVID-19 pandemic, is due on Monday to announce a phased roadmap out of its lockdown, aided by one of the world's fastest vaccine rollouts.

The announcement in parliament at 1530 GMT is expected to confirm the re-opening of schools from March 8 but stipulate a more gradual easing of other restrictions, notably for retailers and hospitality venues.

The following is a snapshot of restrictions in place in Europe's other leading economies:

GERMANY - Non-essential stores are closed until at least March 7. Restaurants can offer meals for take-out only. Museums, gyms and cinemas are closed, and hotels open only to business travellers. Schools in some federal states are partially re-opening from Feb. 22. Companies must offer staff the option to work from home where possible.

FRANCE - A nationwide curfew is in place between the hours of 1800 and 0600. Schools and shops are open but cafes, restaurants and bars are shut, along with theatres, cinemas, museums and galleries. No date has been set for re-opening. Anyone entering France must produce a negative COVID-19 test; entering France from outside the European Union is not allowed except for urgent reasons. ITALY - The country is divided into red, orange, yellow and white zones and restrictions vary accordingly. At present, seven regions and two provinces are in the orange zone; the rest are yellow. Orange zone means bars and restaurants are closed and people cannot leave their towns of residence except for work or emergencies. Schools are closed in these regions but open, at least partly, in yellow zones. Theatres, cinemas and gyms are closed nationwide. Travel between regions is subject to limits. SPAIN - Restrictions vary, with Madrid taking a relaxed approach and allowing customers to eat and drink inside bars and restaurants until 11 p.m. Most other regions are much stricter, but some have started to ease local travel restrictions and reopen non-essential businesses as infections decline, though curfews remain in place between 10 p.m. and midnight nationwide. Schools are open. NETHERLANDS - Schools, non-essential stores, bars and restaurants are all shut. A curfew from 9 p.m. to 04:30 a.m. has been in place since Jan. 23 and is expected to be extended. Elementary schools and day care centres were reopened Feb. 8; hairdressers and high schools are set to follow next week. Those arriving in the Netherlands must provide two negative COVID-19 test results.

SWITZERLAND - The government has proposed allowing the first easing steps from March 1, when shops, museums and libraries can reopen pending a final green light on Wednesday. Private outdoor events with up to 15 people would also be allowed, up from the current limit of five. Schools and many ski lifts remain open, but restaurants and cultural venues closed. Additional easing may follow from April 1 if infection rates allow.

POLAND - On Feb. 12, Poland reopened ski slopes, as well as hotels, cinemas and theatres, at a maximum of 50% capacity for a two-week trial. Shopping centres are open, but restaurants are only allowed to serve food to take away and bars are closed. Children in kindergartens and the first three years of primary school attend lessons as normal; older children study remotely. SWEDEN - Businesses and schools remain largely open, with a focus primarily on voluntary social distancing. High schools for students aged 16 and above have partly moved online while alcohol sales at bars and restaurants are banned after 8.00 pm. Public gatherings of more than eight people are largely forbidden. Various restrictions also apply for foreign nationals entering Sweden and domestic travel.

BELGIUM - Shops, hairdressers, swimming pools and schools can open, although secondary students are only at school half of the time. Beauty parlours may reopen from March 1. Cafes and restaurants are shut and non-essential foreign travel is banned until April 1. Working from home is mandatory where possible.

AUSTRIA - A lockdown was eased this month despite high infections. Shops and hairdressers are now open and schools have in-person lessons, with daily testing. A nighttime curfew is in place and there are restrictions on leaving Tyrol province because of an outbreak of the South African variant. No easing measures are planned until Easter at the earliest. HUNGARY - An 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is in effect with few exceptions; e.g., essential to move for work, health reasons, walking dog close to home). Restaurants are closed except for takeout and delivery. No large public gatherings are allowed. Cultural venues closed, with events online only. Secondary schools and universities are closed, elementary schools open. Weekly testing is mandated for healthcare workers and teachers.

US nears 500,000 Covid deaths
By AFP

PUBLISHED: 16:42, 21 February 2021 | UPDATED: 19:28, 21 February 2021

The United States was on the brink Sunday of the grim milestone of 500,000 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, as the nation's top virus expert warned a semblance of normalcy may not return until the end of the year.

Signs of hope were emerging in the rollout of vaccines and the dropping off of a massive winter spike in infections, but the heavy toll continues to mount in a nation that has reported the most fatalities and cases in the world.

"It's terrible. It is historic. We haven't seen anything even close to this for well over a hundred years, since the 1918 pandemic of influenza," Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said on NBC's "Meet The Press."

"It's something that is stunning when you look at the numbers, almost unbelievable, but it's true," he added, as the toll on the Johns Hopkins University tracking website stood at some 498,000.

After the first Covid-19 death was announced in the United States in February 2020, it took about three months to pass the 100,000 mark, during a first wave that hit New York particularly hard.

But as the outbreak spread across the country, the pace of deaths increased, with the toll jumping from 400,000 in just over a month amid a spike fueled in part by holiday gatherings.

Fauci noted that the number of daily new infections was on a steep decline after peaking in January, but he added normal life may still be some way off.

"I think we'll have a significant degree of normality... as we get into the fall and the winter, by the end of the year," Fauci said on CNN's "State of the Union."

- Damage done by pandemic -

Biden said last week the program to deliver vaccines into people's arms is as complicated as the already intense challenges of manufacturing them in huge quantities at speed.

"There has never, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequential as what we're trying to do, but we're getting it done," he said.

According to Biden, his goal of administering a million shots a day for a total of 100 million in the first 100 days of his presidency is on track to be easily surpassed, with a current average of 1.7 million vaccinations a day.

With the US death toll set soon to pass 500,000, Biden said he did not want to give firm predictions of when the crisis will be curbed.

However, he said that 600 million doses -- enough to provide the two-dose regimen to most of the country -- were expected to be ready by the end of July.

More than 61 million people have received at least one shot of vaccine in the United States, with some 18 million getting the full two doses.

The freezing weather and snow storms that hit the United States for over a week have slowed the nation's vaccine efforts, with some six million doses delayed.

"We've gotten two million (doses) out, and we project that by the middle of the week we will have caught up," said Fauci on "Meet the Press", calling it a "temporary setback."

Though concern has grown around variants of the virus, especially those that appear to spread more easily and render current shots less potent, Fauci sounded a hopeful note on whether another surge was coming.

"I don't think at all that it is inevitable," he told CNN. "The vaccines we are currently distributing now, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, work very well against the UK variant."

America might be past the worst of the pandemic, but the damage is deep and painful.

To illustrate this milestone of half a million deaths, The New York Times published a front-page graphic running the length of the page, with each small point representing a dead American.

The bottom of the column, which represents the deaths of recent months, is particularly dark and almost uniformly black.

New Zealand launches COVID-19 diary app
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 05:05, 20 May 2020 | UPDATED: 05:05, 20 May 2020


Belatedly, and as cases of COVID-19 ease in New Zealand, the government has launched a COVID-19 app to help Kiwis track their movements.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern launched the app on Wednesday, labelling it a "digital diary".

The app differs from the Australian version in not linking to other users.

Instead, it allows Kiwis to check in at different venues - such as cafes and restaurants - and avoid the onerous job of writing down contact details at every place visited.

"It helps users, when they're out and about, keep a log of their own movements," Ms Ardern said.

"This is a way that people can do it that keeps the data for themselves rather than adding it into any more broader repository that might be held by a business."

At this stage, no data is sent to government authorities from the app, though that functionality will be added in an update next month.

The different functionality means there is no user threshold required for the app to be useful. Still, plenty of Kiwis have taken to it.

Even before it was officially launched, 92,000 Kiwis - or almost two per cent of the population - downloaded it.

On Wednesday, Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield announced there were no new cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand for the fourth day in a row,

There have been just two cases in the past week, and 12 overall in the past fortnight.

The ever-decreasing numbers will see bars and nightclubs open for the first time since March on Thursday; provided all customers are seated, in groups under 10, and receive table service.

Ms Ardern will further review caps on gathering numbers- currently set at 10 except for funerals, which are at 50 - at Monday's Cabinet meeting.

"We plan to regularly adjust our settings to allow more activity when the data says it's safe," Ms Ardern said.

Showing how well the virus has been squashed over the past two months, just one New Zealander is being treated in hospital for COVID-19, and does not require intensive care.

PUBLISHED: 05:51, 5 August 2020 | UPDATED: 05:51, 5 August 2020


MEDICINES FALSELY TOUTED AS COVID-19 TREATMENTS

* HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE: Used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. There's no reliable evidence it can prevent or treat COVID-19, and some studies found it may make things worse.

* REMDESIVIR: Antiviral medicine that can help some people in hospital with severe COVID-19 recover faster, but does not help people with milder COVID-19.

* DEXAMETHASONE: Reduces inflammation and is used to treat asthma and arthritis. Reduces the risk of dying for people in hospital with serious COVID-19 that need help to breathe. Doesn't help people with less severe COVID-19 and could make things worse.

* EPHEDRA: Vitamin D, and other complementary medicines: None found to be effective against COVID-19 outside of intensive care.

COVID-19 in schools study: NSW breakdown
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 06:15, 26 April 2020 | UPDATED: 06:15, 26 April 2020

WHAT THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR IMMUNISATION RESEARCH AND SURVEILLANCE (NCIRS) STUDY INTO COVID-19 IN NSW SCHOOLS FOUND:

- A total of 18 students and staff members from 15 NSW schools were from March 5 to April 21, 2020 diagnosed with COVID-19

- Of the 18 people, nine were students and nine were staff members

- Those 18 people had a total of 863 close contacts within school over that time period

- Of the 863 close contacts, just two people caught COVID-19

- Those two people - both students - did not pass the disease on to others

- No ill students passed on the coronavirus to school staff members

- The spread of COVID-19 within NSW schools has thus been "very limited" and the virus' transmission in children in NSW schools is less than that of influenza.

Sydney club shut for repeat COVID breaches
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 04:08, 27 October 2020 | UPDATED: 04:08, 27 October 2020

The Sydney Portugal Community Club is being forced to shut for seven days after failing to comply with COVID-safe regulations - even after three warnings and a $5000 fine.

NSW Liquor & Gaming Director of Compliance Dimitri Argeres said the Portugal Club in Marrickville was the fourth business to be closed for COVID safety breaches.

It will close from 5am on Wednesday 28 for a week.

"Inspectors visited the club three times and observed breaches relating to their COVID-19 Safety Plan, overbooking groups, gaming machine spacing, and inadequate check in processes," Mr Argeres said on Tuesday.

Since the closure order was issued however, some of the things the club was fined for are no longer breaches - for example bookings can now be up to 30 people rather than 10, and while guests need to be spaced at least 1.5 metres apart, gaming machines do not.

"What has not changed, is having robust, digital check in processes that allow for effective contact tracing in the event a positive case has visited the venue," Mr Argeres said.

Service NSW has a free COVID Safe Check-in QR code for all businesses registered as COVID Safe. Anyone can check in using this code - even if they don't have a Service NSW account.

Inspectors from Liquor & Gaming NSW, NSW Fair Trading and SafeWork NSW have now conducted 5605 COVID safety visits, issued 185 penalties worth $817,000 and temporarily closed four businesses.

Tests underway for COVID-19 treatment
By AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS

PUBLISHED: 22:26, 16 August 2020 | UPDATED: 22:26, 16 August 2020

Australian researchers are testing a treatment for coronavirus they hope will provide relief for those infected with COVID-19 and limit its spread.

Professor David Morris and his international team have adapted a cancer treatment known as 'BromAc' that could prevent the virus moving into the lungs of carriers and spreading to other people.

A trial on coronavirus patients is being established with a Melbourne hospital and could start next month.

BromAc has been under development for 11 years for use in cancer treatment and includes two components that together dissolve the spike of COVID-19, rendering it unable to infect other cells.

One of the core agents is a pineapple stem enzyme tested in the lab after it was observed that pigs eating pineapples were resistant to particular gastro conditions.

"We've taken a drug in development for more than a decade and asked whether it can be adapted for treating people infected with COVID-19, Professor David Morris said in a statement on Monday.

"Our lab results show the new drug renders the COVID-19 spike ineffective, stopping it from infecting other cells.

"We hope the results will show the treatment can confine COVID to the nose and throat and prevent lung infection, and stop infected patients from passing on the live virus," he said.

It's hoped an infected person could take the medication at the first signs of COVID-19 and stop the virus in its tracks.

"This could provide a very safe and effective way of saving lives, protecting vulnerable workers preventing hospitalisation and getting people infected by COVID returning back to their everyday lives."

The researchers stress the treatment is not a vaccine for COVID-19 but could work in tandem as a treatment or prevention measure.
