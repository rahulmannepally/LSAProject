Psychology and politics of
COVID-19 misinfodemics:
Why and how do people
believe in misinfodemics?
Sonia Mukhtar
University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan
Abstract
Misinfodemics related to COVID-19 have negatively impacted people’s lives, with adverse
health and psycho-sociopolitical outcomes. As the scientific community seeks to communicate
evidence-based information regarding misplaced preventive strategies and misinformed helpseeking behaviors on global multifaceted systems, a secondary risk has emerged: the effects of
misinfodemics on the public. Published articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Elsevier
about COVID-related misinfodemics have been considered and reviewed in this article. This
review examines the mechanisms, operational structure, prevalence, predictive factors, effects,
responses and potential curtailing strategies of misinfodemics of COVID-19. The present article
shows that the popular variants of COVID-19 misinfodemics could be the joint product of a
psychological predisposition which is either to reject information from experts or perceive the
crisis situation as a product of misinfodemics mechanisms and partisan ideological motivations.
The psychological foundations and political disposition of misinfodemics have implications for the
development of strategies designed to curtail the negative consequences on public health.

the COVID-19 pandemic is even more challenging to curb. The ongoing coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has highlighted the interconnectedness of the modern
globalized world where public health threats can extend far beyond their point of origin
due to the unvarying reliance on and misplaced confidence in media platforms. During
lockdown, quarantine, self-isolation and social distancing, virtual communication has
become the major source of interaction (Holman et al., 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has not only escalated the challenges for
healthcare, social, educational, economic, political, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic systems all over the world but also gained momentum in innumerable
misinfodemics mechanisms: rumors, myths, superstitions, conspiracy theories,
claims, hoaxes, false misinformation, fake news, polarization, mistrust in science in
times of crisis, absence of fact checking, misinformation (misleading content, false
context, manipulated data, fabricated material, imposter documents) and disinformation regarding the etiology and outcomes, and misplaced prevention of the disease
(Mukhtar, 2020a; WHO, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has saturated the mainstream media which disseminate information on a local and global scale. Similarly, social media platforms have
also become an accessible source of (mis)information. Numerous incidents initiated by
these rumors have caused several mishaps across the world. For instance, a man took his
own life after a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 (India), and people have overdosed on
the drug cholorquine after the news about its effectiveness against COVID-19 proliferated (Nigeria) (Busari and Adebayo, 2020; Joe, 2020). There has been a failure to make
a distinction between empirically-based scientific truths and fabricated, unconfirmed
anti-science conspiracy theories among the general public. Such reports reduce the legitimacy of new scientific discoveries regarding a cure or vaccine for COVID-19. This can
also create social stigma, resulting in xenophobia, anti-Chinese sentiment, racism, marginalization, reduced compliance and adherence to quarantine and have adverse health
and psychosocial impacts (Aguilera, 2020; Rana et al., 2020a, 2020b). These considerations become even more exacerbated during lockdown, leading people on the fringe of
popular opinion to spend ever more time on social media. And as people are trying to
make sense of their changed lives, self-proclaimed celebrities, self-identified social
media stars, politicians and the mainstream media’s public figures are propagating their
own subjective interpretations of events in this situation of COVID-19 pandemic (misinfodemics) (Lederer, 2020).
Scientific studies from previous disease outbreaks have demonstrated that misinformation represents a secondary challenge to public health efforts in controlling an epidemic/pandemic (Earnshaw et al., 2019; Kalichman, 2009). Individuals who endorse
misinformation about a disease are less likely to follow public health instructions. During
the Ebola outbreak in 2014, respondents who gave credence to conspiracy theories
alleged that they would be less likely to seek support during the disease outbreak
(National Cancer Institute, 2020). In a 2019 study (Montanaro, 2020) conducted in the
US, over 90% of respondents reported trust in medical healthcare professionals, in contrast to a 2020 study, where the majority of respondents reported mistrust in information
about COVID-19 from the current administration and mainstream media news outlets
(New York Times, 2020).

The psychology of misinfodemics
Fear is an adaptive emotion which serves to mobilize energy towards the potential (actual
or perceived) threat (Mertens et al., 2018). However, when fear is excessive then this
may have detrimental effects on an individual (mental health problems like anxiety and
phobia) and community level (hoarding, panic shopping, xenophobia); when fear is
insufficient then this may also cause harm for both the individual (incompliance and nonadherence towards quarantine and isolation) and community (reckless implementation of
policies that ignores risks to the socioeconomic infrastructure). Likewise, interpersonal
safety measures can mitigate certain threats (transmission of disease) but can paradoxically enhance fear (fear of transmission, excessive health anxiety and psychosocial
issues). Similarly, social safety measures (lockdowns, curfews) help to control the transmission but prolonged and stringent measures could have negative consequences (socioeconomic impact, mental health impact).
Efforts to curb the misinfodemics process have increased because of its adverse
effects on public health communication and to encourage the adoption of sustainable
preventive measures, to manage social and physical distancing, psychological health and
resilience in socioeconomic conditions, and to address stigma, prejudice, discrimination
and inequalities (Mukhtar, 2020b). Among the various factors of psychological vulnerability (Mukhtar, 2020c; Mukhtar and Mahmood, 2018), a propensity to follow popular
opinion, excessive social media presence and a predisposition to anxiety and fear lead to
uncertainty, intolerance, and unpredictability. Coronavirus brings high levels of uncertainty and the inability to cope with uncertainty is exponentially higher causing anxiety,
fear and health-related worry. This situation is exacerbated by the exposure to a plethora
of information (including misinformation and disinformation) about the impending
threat, from mainstream media and social media alike (Rosser, 2019). Perceived threat
information elevates fear, and repeated engagement with trauma-related media content
for several hours daily culminates in acute stress and emotional distress and consequently
will either increase the fear of the virus, or cause insensitivity towards its course.
Identification and monitoring of the internet's ‘centrifugal clarification’ to filter the
accuracy of content has become more challenging as an increasing number of people rely
on social media platforms. One of the challenging problems of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media is the way they emulsify into false,
misleading and click-bait content. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a
‘mythbuster’ feature on its website as a countermeasure to the spread of unauthentic
news on social media. People who reported the highest media exposure reported higher
acute stress (Holman et al., 2020). Media exposure accumulates ever emerging threats
and repeated exposure to these events increase the symptoms of distress. Worry, fixation,
herd mentality and misplaced conviction make people more vulnerable to media exposure distress.
Alongside the amount of media exposure, the type and content of exposure matters as
well – exposure to tragic events, graphic images, conspiracy theories and violence could
instigate posttraumatic stress and fear of the future which will lead to poor personal
functioning. In recent years, the mainstream media (electronic, print and social media)
have established themselves beyond one government-run channel and the global 
114 International Sociology 36(1)
population has developed an affinity for the news channels in particular. While the older
population mainly relies on more traditional news channels, youth look to social media
such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Social media
have become a new conduit for spreading rumors, deliberate misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories and personally motivated anecdotes to appeal to followers
and attract attention and create panic (Liang et al., 2020). Some self-proclaimed celebrities and media stars have become so influential that a large number of people rely solely
on their content (Merchant, 2020). Some social media ‘posts’ are circulating on many
platforms and are endorsed by multiple social media account users to encourage optimal
personal functioning, maximum productivity, business-oriented activities, and downplaying the intensity of this traumatic event. Certain posts like ‘if you don’t come out of
this quarantine with a new skill, your side hustle started, more knowledge, then you
never lacked time, you lacked discipline’ circulating on various social media accounts,
prompting people to utilize their time in learning new things and skills, exacerbate the
worry for already anxiety-prone individuals and place psychological pressure to be productive. Rather, messages like ‘if you don’t come out of this quarantine with a new skill,
your side hustle started, more knowledge, then you are doing just fine’ should be disseminated on social media, for individuals to realize that during such an intense traumatic event not everyone is equally endowed with the strength, coping strategies and
problem solving skills to transform trauma into a positive emotion, which is okay and not
a source of shame and guilt.
There is a coercive impression percolating among individuals regarding the lockdown
that people should not assume it is a holiday, but that they must utilize their time productively and engage in occupational or academic activities. This psychological pressure has
further aggravated feelings of guilt, shame, regret, sadness, self-pity, anger, internalized
emotions, being overwhelmed, negative self-talk, unrealistic expectations and a perceived sense of failure (see Mukhtar, 2020a, 2020b). The psychological pressure to compete with peers in achieving a maximum of tasks, producing occupational and academic
outcomes, harnessing a herd of followers and subscribers on one’s media accounts, and
downplaying one’s own trauma and that of others will have devastating effects on mental
wellbeing.
Lockdown resulting in self-isolation, quarantine and social distancing is far removed
from normal leisure time that might be utilized for improved personal functioning – it is a
collective traumatic event which poses a serious threat to people and has resulted in a huge
loss of lives and displacement for many individuals (Mukhtar and Mukhtar, 2020; Mukhtar
and Rana, 2020). COVID-19 is an individual and collective traumatic event and directly or
indirectly has affected every individual in the world. All efforts should be directed towards
minimizing the negative effects of this traumatic COVID-19 pandemic on ‘survivors’.
Many people are going through interpersonal traumatic events in addition to the collective
trauma of COVID-19: domestic violence (gender-based violence), abuse (Mukhtar, 2020d),
financial burden, loneliness, emotional and behavioral problems, grief and bereavement,
fear of losing family, mental health issues, physical injuries or fatalities .
Isolated people facing psychological issues require trauma-focused psychological
support (mental health care, psychological support, guidance, treatment, intervention
and information) such as psychological cyber-counseling, via one’s smartphone for 
Mukhtar 115
instance, and mental health hotlines. Professional help-seeking behaviors should be
encouraged and endorsed and related barriers like stigma, marginalization, discrimination, shaming and phobias should be discouraged through government-driven programs
and evidence-based treatment models.
Emerging pandemics command the intellectual incapacity of decision-making (a
degree of irrationality) when bombarded with conflicting opinions and conspiracy theories and thus the empirical interpretation of origins and impacts result in moral judgments
based on religious and cultural beliefs. The emergence of HIV/AIDS garnered a plethora
of moral judgments orbiting around sexual morality and substance abuse; the arrival of
SARS saw blame directed towards primitive farming practices in Guangzhou; and the
unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has welcomed a magnitude of misinfodemics on a
multitude of fronts (Ophir, 2018; Richtel, 2020). A psychological predisposition to reject
authorized information through denial as a byproduct of deep founded mistrust, and the
tendency to view major social and political events through conspiracies and partisan motivations as a byproduct of conspiracy thinking are the likely explanatory factors in understanding ‘why’ and ‘who’ believes in COVID-19 misinfodemics. The association between
conspiracy thinking and defense-mechanism denial could be a potential reason for the
refusal of corrective actions in several health-related cases (Carey et al., 2020).
Misinfodemics could be motivated by various factors – an epistemic desire for causal
explanation and subjective certainty, or an existential desire for control and security, or the
social desire to maintain a positive image of the self or group (Douglas et al., 2017).
Stigmatization, labeling, scapegoating and fear swiftly follow with a narrative which
invokes the vernacular of human conflict – waging war against a killer virus, an indomitable invisible threat, an enemy armed with no-vaccine flinging victims in quarantine
camps – losing a sense of proportion and the ability to mitigate fear and use reasonable
knowledge-based measures to challenge and normalize the perceived threat of infection.
The mechanism of misinfodemics is engrossed in silos of public information which is
inept at limiting risks (Wald, 2008), for instance: the social theme focusing on socioeconomic disruption; the scientific theme focusing on medical and health risk communication; and the pandemic theme focusing on state and global response. Populations most
likely to be affected by an emerging disease pandemic and a simultaneous misinfodemics
include those where there is a disproportionally low or inadequate health literacy, disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, migrants, ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups
including older people, people with chronic health conditions and people with disability
(Mukhtar, 2020e; Rowlands et al., 2015).
The politics of coronavirus
Conspiracy theories heavily influenced by geopolitics have spread regarding the origin,
scale, prevention, treatment and self-diagnosis of the disease: of COVID-19 being a viral
bioweapon genetically engineered by a rogue government with a racist and genocidal
agenda to wage an economic and psychological war – the Chinese biological weapon
conspiracy theory (which has spread throughout the United States, United Kingdom,
India and Ukraine), or the US biological weapon conspiracy theory (spread throughout
Russia, Iran, China, the Philippines and Venezuela); a plot by Muslims, or a plot by Jews; 
116 International Sociology 36(1)
espionage; a population control scheme; and medical misinformation (vaccine’s preexistence, cocaine cure, African resistance, 5G, vegetarian immunity and methanol use)
and other views endorsed by presidents, governments and public figures abound, causing
misinfodemics of incorrect information about the virus, etc., which poses risks on a
global scale (McCarthy, 2020).
Meanwhile, COVID-19 could be positively viewed through the partisan lens of
right-wing nationalism and the pandemonium of allegations. Coronavirus is a gift for
the politics of misinfodemics, censorship and pathological nationalism. A multitude of
governments have ‘introduced’ a policy of blame-shifting by launching their powerrivalry statements revolving around illogical reasoning and a narrative of national
immunity towards COVID-19: in the US there are claims of a ‘biological weapon
against the Western world’, ‘Chinese experiment gone wrong’, ‘China as equivalent to
USSR-level threat’ and the most infamous ‘Chinese virus’; Italy has accused migrants
from Africa as the disease carriers to its shores; in France, Hungary and the UK there
is the narration of a correlation between immigrants and coronavirus (reminiscent of
the influx of migrants from war-inflicted countries in 2015 and the so-called border
crisis); European right-wingers declare the ‘enemy has not changed, it is migrants’.
And so the convergence of two crises aggravates mistrust in scientific, political and
economic bodies around the world. These narratives imply through a heavily nuanced
differential discourse that their countries are immune to coronavirus and they would
not have contracted COVID-19, or could manage it effectively, if only for the absence
of immigrants (McCarthy, 2020).
COVID-19 has provided rich fodder for Europe’s nativist populist tune to further
incite the clamor to bar immigrants and building walls/closing borders, to anti-immigration policies. Public opinions are shaped by the landscape of media, scientific bodies and
the frameworks of governments and thus such obstinate prejudice and confrontations
ignite de-globalization, nationalism, nativism, protectionism, tariffs, closed borders and
erection of walls which will intensify the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
In Pakistan, a research study conducted by IPSOS revealed that 82% of people in the
country believed that performing ablution will keep them protected from transmitting
coronavirus, and others believed that congregation prayers and shaking hands cannot
infect anyone since it is Sunnah (SAMAA, 2020). Claims circulating about Pakistanis’
resistance to coronavirus were quite prevalent as they were backed by Pakistan’s relatively low mortality rate. These rumors argued that Pakistan’s culture, religion, geographical location and climate made Pakistanis less vulnerable to the virus. In India,
political activists claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung to one’s body
can cure coronavirus; a parliamentarian claimed that saying Namaste instead of Arab
greetings prevents the contraction of coronavirus; an influential film celebrity claimed
that vibrations generated by clapping and blowing conch shells will kill the virus; a selfproclaimed TikTok media star’s claim about eating a poisonous fruit as a preventive
measure hospitalized 11 people; and an ‘anti-coronavirus drug’ and ‘anti-coronavirus
mattress’ have been quite prevalent. For example, a popular myth in various countries is
that home remedies can cure or prevent people from contracting coronavirus. One of
these rumored remedies that has gained traction on social media (with severe, adverse
effects) involves mixing sodium chlorite solution with citric acid, producing chlorine 
Mukhtar 117
dioxide – a powerful bleaching agent – claiming antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial
benefits. Similar phenomena were observed all over the world, which may have prolonged the health, psychosocial and economic consequences of COVID-19 among the
general public (Shu et al., 2017).
It becomes more difficult to limit the negative impact of misinfodemics especially when
partisanship can be mobilized in this effort. There could be three strategies to overcome
these negative effects: (a) prevention strategies – to limit the aim and spread of, or exposure to misinfodemics; (b) corrective strategies – founded in scientific and empirical
knowledge to challenge these predispositions, their effects and subsequent belief system
and reduce uncertainty, increase perceived control and promote self-image; (c) collaborative strategies – corrective strategies can be efficacious if other political and social agents
can be activated and mobilized to override partisan, ideological motivations and misinfodemics tendencies. When politics and the media promote misinformation, likeminded individuals exposed to this rhetoric are more likely to follow elite cues and motivated reasoning
and engage with these ideas. Cues from partisan elites have the potential to inflame and
foster misinfodemics as they shape the landscape of information for the general public
(Swire et al., 2017). For instance, at the outset of COVID-19, the American political administration referred to COVID-19 as a ‘new hoax’ (Rieder, 2020) and likened the pandemic to
common flu (Brooks, 2020) or coronavirus as a bioweapon (Stevenson, 2020). This rhetoric is likely to encourage the adoption of related beliefs and lead likeminded supporters to
take the threat less seriously. Media outlets including news personalities and media figures
cast aspersion on the threat of COVID-19 by questioning if hospitals were truly filled with
coronavirus infected patients (Peters, 2020). After the toll on human life became increasingly apparent and unassailable, change in the reporting and behavior on the part of media
and political leaders who had previously (explicitly and unequivocally) trafficked in misinfodemics now hinted at the possibility of misinformation having actually served to correct and prevent negative consequences among the general public.
Animosity, wrapped in hatred inside the hostility
Some media channels initially ran racially labeled and biased headlines on COVID-19, such
as ‘Chinese virus pandemonium’, ‘China kids stay home’, ‘China is the real sick man of
Asia’, ‘Chinese coronavirus’, or ‘kung-flu’, which caused xenophobia and misperceptions,
misled the general public and witnessed a surge in anti-Chinese sentiment and racist-driven
cases against individuals of Chinese origin outside China. Anti-Chinese and anti-Asian xenophobia has been reported in many countries including the US, the UK, Australia and many
European countries. Many Chinese customers were refused entrance into restaurants in
Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia (Amnesty International, 2020).
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
issued a statement on Twitter: ‘It’s understandable to be alarmed by #Coronavirus. But
no amount of fear can excuse prejudice & discrimination against people of Asian descent.
Let’s #FightRacism, call out hatred & support each other in this time of a public health
emergency. #StandUp4HumanRights.’
A similar response on Twitter began ‘#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus’ (‘I am not a virus’) after
a French newspaper’s front-page headline, ‘Yellow alert’. Ontario’s Human Rights 
118 International Sociology 36(1)
Commission (OHRC) stated that discrimination is prohibited under the Human Rights
Code (Aguilera, 2020; Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2020).
A government’s dilemma – to be or not to be
At the time of writing, the government of Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister
Mr Imran Khan has witnessed a sudden setback, as with the number of cases steadily
increasing their challenge is to curtail the path of the disease in Pakistan. However, there
is a bigger dilemma the government of Pakistan is facing – to be or not to be – partial
lockdown or no lockdown. Either way, this message has a common intention – to minimize the urgency and severity of the pandemic, downplay social isolation measures, disregard the potential crisis in the health sector (while exaggerating the impact on the
economy for the recession that looms on the horizon) and overlook the mitigating measures necessary to stem transmission and medical mistrust among the public (Alwan et al.,
2020; Prem et al., 2020). Religion, politics and business – fundamentally governing
aspects of Pakistan – are opposed to the lockdown and are putting pressure on the government, consequently resulting in the lifting of lockdown. In Pakistan, pandemic or no pandemic, hardline clerics hold the power to override the government’s social-distancing
instructions, put in place in April 2020. Dozens of well-known clerics signed a letter
warning that the government should exempt mosques from the shutdown during the
month of Ramadan or otherwise invite ‘God’s wrath’ (an ulterior narrative insinuating the
political chaos that clerics have unleashed in the past), exercising their religious authority
to gather loyalists to lay siege on the state. The subservient state has already signed an
agreement deferentially promising to abide by the deal, begging the question: who is in
charge of the government during this pandemic crisis – the government or mosques?
Physical and mental health, social and interpersonal factors including intimate partner
violence, marital rape, child abuse, domestic violence, racism, xenophobia, dissociation,
bias, prejudice, stigmatization and marginalization are the least of Pakistani clerics and
mosques’ concerns during this public crisis. Clerics have to protect their two central interests: money and power. Millions of dollars of charitable donations during Ramadan benefit Pakistan’s mosques, which are not under the state’s authority, and clerics who often
partake in political power can challenge the government. Despite all the evidence, a prevalent rhetoric undermining the COVID-19 related risks has been endorsed (and ‘austerely’
followed by the public) at the highest level of authority in Pakistan: the clerics.
Religious misinfodemics is a new branch of clerics’ superciliously propagated doctrine narrated through the lens of pandemic religious-explanation: God could not have
allowed such a disease to emerge and only through rigorous devotion in congregational
prayer can followers of the faith conquer the devil’s machinations in the form of coronavirus; and if anyone tries to halt these efforts then these Zionist agents are the pawns of
evil bent on destroying the faith. This dogmatic doctrine seeps through the ever present,
ever omniscient online media to infiltrate the minds of sheeple-votary-conformists – usually the heads of the household who enforce these maladaptive cognitive twisted patterns
within their families. These instructions dictated by the ‘higher authorities’, and their
adherence, are infringing on individual rights and freedom, planting unquestionable
canon, propagating anti-science and medical mistrust among the public, putting people 
Mukhtar 119
at risk, and halting the emergency control and preventive measures necessary to curb the
pandemic and thus creating public panic, social unrest and distrust in systems (Kalb,
2003; Strong, 1990). These eschewed beliefs can result in adverse behavioral consequences (for instance, failing to administer polio vaccination to one’s children, attributing it as un-Islamic, and contributing to the resurgence of this once eradicated disease in
Pakistan). Misinfodemics, especially those which revolve around science, medicine and
health-related topics, are widespread and prompting people to eschew appropriate healthrelated behaviors (Jolley and Douglas, 2014; Oliver and Wood, 2014).
Potential strategies of curtailment
As research has predicted, there are psychosocial stress and adverse health outcomes for
people in self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine, and this crisis situation will
require remediation from credible sources of information. These include, in the US for
example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), and especially WHO, which has partnered with several social media
platforms and technological companies (Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter,
Facebook and YouTube) to promote health updates and curb misinformation and disinformation (Hossain et al., 2020). They are seeking to safeguard and ensure effective communication on COVID-19 between healthcare systems and the general public. Despite all
these efforts, infodemics is rampant and multiple misinformation and disinformation
sources are circulating on social media accounts. To address these discrepancies, certain
strategies can be implemented: (a) empirically evidence-based scientific research findings
→ with integration in communication and information technology → to frontline healthcare providers → who communicate with patients and caregivers and populations at risk
→ results in positive health outcomes → and subsequent optimization of resources; (b)
building strategic partnerships (local and global levels) → coordinate connecting offline
and online resources for the communication of uniform information → across all platforms from mass media, community organizations and support groups → to community
and society; (c) contain infodemics of information and disinformation → and disseminate
scientifically evidence-based information → through ‘data-mining algorithms’ to detect
and remove fake news (Shu et al., 2017); (d) those who propagate misinformation
(accountable individuals and online portals) should be identified by local authorities and
law enforcement agencies → precautionary culturally tailored information, translated into
multiple language manuals of factual data regarding COVID-19 should be promoted
through mass media campaigns; and (e) an e-care evidence-based approach and e-services
in local languages (mostly graphic and pictorial for easy understanding) should be made
available → for people with limited access to healthcare, elderly people, rural areas, the
general public in self-isolation and quarantined → to decrease COVID-19 infection.
It is imperative to bring communities and institutional leadership together to promote
transparency and good information governance to control the misinfodemics related to
COVID-19 for both people’s physical, mental and psychosocial health and sound economic, political and systematic functioning during this pandemic (Oliver and Wood, 2014).
The world needs coordinated national and international efforts to apply the scientific
empirical data in local settings to mitigate the grave predicament of lockdown aftereffects 
120 International Sociology 36(1)
and associated issues. Mass media, healthcare organizations, community-based organizations and stakeholders should strategically join in partnership to disseminate, based on
mutual consensus, empirically-based public health messages and remove anti-science
online content through natural language processing and data-mining approaches. The best
global solution for a global disease is international collaboration – the exchange of scientific ideas, health communication and facilitating coordination.



NEW PAPER


Impact of COVID-19 on Psychology among the University
Students
Bablu Kumar Dhar,* Foster Kofi Ayittey, and Sabrina Maria Sarkar
The purpose of the study is to find out the psychological impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on university students. The study focuses on the
university students from different public and private universities of
Bangladesh through a set of questionnaires according to the guideline
of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The result among 15 543
respondents shows that 44.59% are suffering from severe anxiety, 48.41%
moderate anxiety, and only 3.82% mild anxiety. The results highlight that
all epidemic-related stressors are positively correlated with the level of
anxiety. Among the epidemic-related stressors, worry about economic
influences during and after COVID-19 (r = 0.342, p < 0.001) and worry about
the influence of COVID-19 on daily life (r = 0.340, p < 0.001) have a highly
positive impact on the level of anxiety. Following these stressors, worry about
academic delays due to COVID-19 (r = 0.326, p < 0.001) and worry about the
social support during COVID-19 (r = 0.321, p < 0.001) have moderately and
positively correlated with the level of anxiety. The study suggests that proper
government support, as well as social awareness, should be monitored
during epidemics for decreasing anxiety and maintaining a good mental
health of the university students.
1. Introduction
In 2020, the current population density of Bangladesh is 1115.55 
people per square kilometer, which is a 1.01% increase than last 
year. Because of the density of population, Bangladesh is the 
12th most densely populated country in the world.[1]
 According 
to the report of the World Economic Forum, COVID-19 threatens to cause a humanitarian crisis in 
this country. According to the World Bank 
data, in Bangladesh, 15% of workers earn 
more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day and the 
economic shutdown sparked by COVID-19 
endangers millions of livelihoods imminently. The people could meet their 
daily expenditures, sent their children to 
school, and expected that they could save 
money for an emergency health crisis. 
The majority of villagers depend on remittances from the cities or overseas. However, for the current global crisis, people 
are out of work. Income has halted.
Based on the report of the Reuters, the 
COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to 
have spread to Bangladesh on March 2020 
after recognizing the first three known 
cases reported on March 7, 2020, by the 
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control 
and Research (IEDCR) of the country.[2]
According to IEDCR, Bangladesh, the 
level of infections remained low at the end 
of March, although there was a precipitous 
rise in April. In the week ending April 16, new cases in Bangladesh grew 1155%, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia with 
186%. As of June 3, 2020, there are a total of 57 563 confirmed 
cases besides 12 161 recovered and 781 death cases.
The novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) is spreading faster all 
over the country. The current situation imposes massive pressure on the government of Bangladesh, the general public, and 
healthcare, and medical providers.[3]
 The pandemic has brought 
not only the danger of death from the epidemiologic contagion but also an intolerable psychological burden to the people 
among the world[4,5]
 and Bangladesh is not out of the problems. The faster spread of the virus; strict isolation measures; 
and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across 
the country are anticipated to influence the psychology of university students.[6]
 Psychological reports indicate the influence 
of the epidemic on the children, public, older adults, medical 
staff, and patients.[7–9]
 However, no thorough research on the 
psychology of university students facing the epidemic has been 
conducted to date.
Like other sectors, the education sector has been affected 
severely in Bangladesh. On March 17, 2020, the government 
closed all schools, colleges, and universities when Bangladesh 
had eight confirmed cases. Among 853  267 students out of 
104  universities in Bangladesh, the number of public universities is 33 with 454  530 students, and the number of private 
universities is 71 with 398  737 students. The average student count for a public university is 13  774, and 5616 for a private 
university that indicates that there are 8204 students per university. Having a vast number of undergraduate, graduate, and 
postgraduate students, the country wishes a secure future that 
has been temporary collapsed due to the current pandemic.
For detecting anxiety disorders, the seven-item Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is one of the extensively used 
tools that is easy to score and takes less than 1–3 min to finish.[6]
Moreover, the GAD-7 is also applicable for diagnosis, screening, 
and the valuation of the strictness of anxiety disorders, and also 
for panic disorders, stress disorders, post-traumatic disorders, 
and social phobia.[10]
The prior problem of the students of university is mostly 
related to their career and future. Due to the uncertainty, stress 
increases among university students;[11]
 hence, the method of 
supervisory university students during public health crises is 
different and challenging. Therefore, the study aimed to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among 
university students in Bangladesh. Moreover, the study intends 
to provide suggestions to the government and non-government 
organizations for taking the necessary steps.
2. Results
2.1. Demographic Statistics
Table 1 shows the demographic and particular characteristics 
of the population of the study. The table indicates the 15 543 
university students, most of the respondents are male (66.7%), 
approximately two-thirds of them live in the urban area (76.1%), 
most of their financial status is not steady (61.6%), majority 
of the participants live with their parents (78.1%), and many 
of their relatives or friends are not infected with COVID-19 
(87.4%). However, 12.6% of the relatives or friends of the 
respondents have been infected by the virus.
2.2. Anxiety Level among University Students during the 
Outbreak
Table 2 demonstrates the psychological health of university 
students who have been affected during the epidemic. It is 
shocking to observe that most of the students are at a high 
level of anxiety, and their psychological condition is alarming. 
Among 15 543 students, a very few number of students are in 
normal (3.18%) and mild (3.82%) level of anxiety. However, 
nearly half of the students are at a moderate level of anxiety 
(48.41%), and the rest of them are suffering from very high or 
severe level (44.59%) of anxiety.
2.3. Influencing Factors of Anxiety among University Student 
during the Outbreak
2.3.1. Univariate Analysis
The association between the demographic variables and the 
level of nervousness or anxiety among Bangladeshi university 
students are pointed in Table 3. The analysis shows that all factors have a significant effect on anxiety. During the epidemic, 
gender has a significant effect on anxiety (p < 0.05) and males 
are severely worried (16.88%) than female during the epidemic; 
place of residence in the urban area has a significant impact on 
anxiety and living in the urban area creates moderate anxiety 
(18.79%) than rural areas; living with their parents has a substantial consequence on anxiety and students who live alone 
has amplified anxiety level (p < 0.05). On the other hand, 
financial condition, and the infection of COVID-19 among 
relatives or friends have the most significant effect on anxiety 
(p < 0.001).
2.3.2. Ordinal Regression Analysis
Table 4 points out the consequences of ordinal multivariate 
analysis of related influences with anxiety level through the 
epidemic among the university students of Bangladesh. Significant influences from the univariate analysis comprised in 
the analysis of ordered logistic regression (OLR) in the table. 
The model test indicates that the value of odds ratio (OR) of all 
variables was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 
chi-square test (χ2 = 14.170) of the observed values indicates a 
good model fit. Results from the OLR analysis of the factors 
that influence anxiety level among university students indicate 
that “living in urban areas” causes more anxiety (OR = 1.940; 
CI = 1.830, –2.740); unstable financial condition causes more

worry in comparison with stable financial condition (OR = 2.920; 
CI = 1.910, –3.540); living without parents increases nervousness level (OR = 1.270; CI = 0.850, 1.730); and infected relatives 
or friends with novel coronavirus enhance anxiety’s risk factor 
(OR = 3.750; CI = 2.950, –3.980).
2.3.3. Correlation between the Level of Anxiety and 
Epidemic-Related Stressors
Table 5 indicates the result of the correlation analysis between 
the level of anxiety and COVID-19 epidemic-related stressors, 
including worry about economic influences, worry about 
academic delays, worry about the influence of COVID-19 on 
daily life, and worry about the social support during COVID-19. 
The results highlight that all epidemic-related stressors are positively associated with the level of anxiety. Among the epidemicrelated stressors, worry about economic influences during 
and after COVID-19 (r = 0.342, p < 0.001) and worry about the 
influence of COVID-19 on daily life (r = 0.340, p < 0.001) have 
a highly positive impact on the level of anxiety level. Following 
these stressors, worry about academic delays due to COVID-19 
(r = 0.326, p < 0.001) and worry about the social support during 
COVID-19 (r = 0.321, p <  0.001) are moderately and positively 
connected with the level of anxiety.
3. Discussion
According to previous studies, public health emergencies have 
several psychological effects on students who study in higher 
educational institutions. According to Cornine,[12]
 college students’ anxiety is connected to the consequence of the virus. 
Bao et al.[13]
 mentioned that the growing number of infected and

suspected patients has increased anxiety level among students. 
Ayittey et  al.[14,15]
 highlighted the significant scarcity of masks 
and sanitizers, and the devastating, astonishing, and erroneous 
news reports in different social media had increased anxiety 
and fear. The study of Cao et  al.[6]
 pointed that the anxiety 
among college students during the epidemic was related with 
their place of residence, source of parental income, whether 
living with parents, and whether a relative or an acquaintance 
was infected with the epidemic without significant difference 
in gender or region that is dissimilar from the conclusions of 
Moreno et  al.[10]
 Cao et  al.[6]
 concluded that male and female 
students have similar stresses and negative emotions as a 
result of COVID-19. The study of Mei at al.[16]
 indicated fear 
and anxiety. Elmer et al.[17]
 and Wang et al.[18]
 focused on future 
employment. Cornine[12]
 emphasized on infection of relatives 
or friends during the epidemic. Kmietowicz[19]
 and Xiao[5]
 highlighted the psychological condition during long interpersonal 
communication.
The foremost intention of the current study was to assess the 
psychological situation of university students during the current 
epidemic, COVID-19, and to explore the influencing factors of 
their anxiety. The study found that almost 97% of the university 
students were experiencing anxiety due to the outbreak of the 
current epidemic. Among the students who participated, 48.41% 
are suffering from a moderate level of anxiety, and 44.59% are 
experiencing a severe level of anxiety. On the other hand, the 
amount of experiencing a mild level of anxiety (3.82%) and not 
feeling anxiousness (3.18%) is very poor in ratio. This current 
study shows an opposite scenario of the study of Cao et  al.[6]
The study of Cao et  al.[6]
 highlighted the psychological condition of college students of China during COVID-19. The study 
of Cao et al.[6]
 indicated that among Chinese students only 0.9% 
experienced severe anxiety and 21.3% experienced mild anxiety 
during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The economy of urban areas is relatively significant and 
delivers citizens with better safety,[20]
 and living in urban areas 
is a protective factor against anxiety.[6]
 There is indeed an inequity of cultural, economic, and education between rural and 
urban areas. For example, hygienic conditions in urban areas 
are healthier than rural, which reduces the chances of surviving and spreading of COVID-19.[21]
 However, the univariate 
analysis and OLR analysis of factors on the level of anxiety 
among the students of universities in Bangladesh show a different scenario. In explanation, the participants mentioned the 
reason of overdensity among the urban areas in Bangladesh. 
Most of the higher educational institutions are in urban areas. 
Due to the reason, a majority of the students live in urban 
areas and experience immense anxiety during the current 
epidemic.
Living without parents was another favorable factor for 
increasing anxiety among students. The current study also 
finds a similar result regarding this factor with the study of 
Cao et al.[6]
 Earlier studies also have specified that the risk factors connected with anxiety and emotional sicknesses among 
adults comprise not living with parents, parents’ physical and 
psychological problems, and the death of parents in infantile,[22]
which are reliable with the results of the present study.
Financial stability or condition matters much on anxiety 
among the students.[6]
 Elmer et  al.,[17]
 also found that the 
constancy of family income has a significant influence on the 
anxiety level of the university students during the COVID-19 
catastrophe.
Higher levels of stress are connected with young age, having 
to go out to work, female gender, and having an acquaintance infected with COVID-19.[23]
 The contemporary study also 
found that having relatives or friends being infected with novel 
coronavirus becomes a risk factor among university students’ 
anxiety during the epidemic. According to the respondents, it 
generates high contagiousness of the COVID-19.[24]
Economic stressors, academic delays, effects on daily life, 
and families or friends being infected with epidemic are 
positively related to anxiety among the university students of 
Bangladesh during the epidemic. Similar studies by Cao et al.[6]
have specified that along with the national health condition, 
COVID-19 also has a substantial influence on the economy of 
the country as well as individuals.[25]
 Bangladesh remains on 
a knife-edge in COVID-19 crisis. The lockdowns prompted by 
the epidemic has already deteriorated the economic and political stability of the country. Due to the outbreak, many families 
are losing their source of income, and students are feeling worried about paying their tuition fees.[26]
 Hunger, malnutrition, 
and other related problems have augmented in Bangladesh as 
a result of the lockdown.[26]
 Like other countries, all primary, 
secondary schools, high schools, colleges, and universities were 
closed and delaying classes until March 17, 2020, which creates 
more anxiety among students. For reducing anxiety regarding 
this issue, using distant/remote learning methods can be a 
good model. These actions certainly have a precise influence on 
education and the development of students.
Social support is also positively correlated with the anxiety 
of the university students of Bangladesh, which is not consistent with previous findings.[6,7]
 According to the participants of the study, social support lessens the mental pressure 
during the epidemic and changes the attitude regarding social 
support that is rare to find in the society by the students. 
The social support in Bangladesh is not run under a single 
umbrella like the developed countries. Even the supports from 
the government are not well enough.[27]
 This consequence 
indicates that active and vigorous social support is essential 
during public health emergencies to reduce the anxiety level 
among the students.
4. Conclusions
Being burdened with population, Bangladesh becomes one of 
the major risky zones during COVID-19 epidemic where financial, physical, and psychological crisis arise in every moment. 
The overall situation creates a deep psychological impact among 
the university students of Bangladesh. About 97% of university students are in deep anxiety due to the current epidemic. 
Living in urban areas, not having a steady financial situation, 
not living with parents, and infection of relatives or friends in 
epidemic become the severe factors for severe anxiety among 
university students during the outbreak of novel coronavirus. 
The stressors of the COVID-19, including economic stressors, 
academic delays, impact on daily life, and social supports, are 
entirely linked with the symptoms of anxiety levels among

the university students of Bangladesh during the epidemic. 
Though the government of Bangladesh is adopting several 
policies regarding this issue, consciousness and preventive 
measurements of the inhabitants of the country according to 
the guidelines of World Health Organization are needed more 
to resolve the critical problem with high priority. Proper government support, as well as social awareness, should be monitored 
during epidemics to decrease anxiety and maintaining the good 
mental health of the university students for crafting a better 
future of the nation.
5. Experimental Section
Study Population and Sample: For the analysis, the study targeted the 
public and private university students of Bangladesh. The respondents 
were selected randomly from different universities in different cities 
in Bangladesh. By using a structured, reliable, and confidential 
questionnaire, the study tried to measure the psychological health of 
the university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total number 
of 15  543 respondents responded (100% response rate) willingly for 
discovering the psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among 
university students in Bangladesh.
Instruments: For finding out the psychological impact on the 
university students of Bangladesh, the study used GAD-7 that comprises 
seven items constructed on seven core symptoms and queries to 
find out the respondents who suffered within the last 2 weeks.[28]
 The 
total score range of the questions was 0–21 followed by a four-point 
Likert scale from 0 to 3 (not at all to almost every day).[6]
 Moreover, 
the study tried to find out the related demographic information of the 
respondents, including gender, place of residence, financial situation, 
living condition, and status of the infection of COVID-19 among their 
relatives or friends. Furthermore, the respondents were queried about 
their thoughts and preventive behaviors, economic conditions, academic 
progress, availability of social support, and influence on daily life 
during the epidemic. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s ɑ) of GAD-7 
is 0.929.
Data Analysis: SPSS (version 25.0) was used to analyze the 
collected data. The study implemented several statistical methods 
to justify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic among the Bangladeshi 
university students, including descriptive statistics to demonstrate 
the demographic features; univariate analysis (nonparametric test) to 
discover the significant relations between sample characteristics and 
anxiety level;[29]
 multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine 
statistical significance among the variables through odds ratio with 95% 
confidence of interval;[6]
 Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) with a 
two-tailed statistical significance (p < 0.05) to assess the connotation 
between novel coronavirus-related stressors and the level of anxiety.
Ethical Considerations: The department of students’ affairs of different 
universities approved this study. The university authorities also felt 
interested to know the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on 
the students. After describing the need of the study, respondents gave 
their consent voluntarily

Psychological aspects
Law enforcement
In December 2019, an unknown Virus starts affecting the human
being from Wuhan seafood market, China due to trade of various animals and birds viz bats, snakes, birds etc. Though exactly the source of
virus is unknown, the Wuhan Institute of Virology declared that it is 96
% identical to Corona Virus found in bats (Anon, 2020g). Initially, it
was believed that this virus was not a communal spread virus. A lot of
people migrated to Wuhan to celebrate their annual Chunyun festival.
This large get together for the festival, cause the virus to spread among
them. Without knowing this, they started to travelled back to their
places. Due to this, the virus starts affecting more than 200 countries
across the globe.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the virus as Covid –
19. The initial symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties
and when it is severe, results in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
syndrome and at last result in loss of life (Anon, 2020h). The stage of
spread of virus include 4 stages. In stage 1, the people are affected when
they are travelling to affected countries. In stage 2, the people who are
very closely interacting with the affected people in stage 1 (Anon,
2020e). In stage 3, community spreads occur and still the disease can be
controlled. In stage 4, the massive number of people are affected and it
is very difficult to control.
In India, though the first case of Corona was reported on 29th
January 2020, the virus starts spreading from 1st week of March 2020.
The Government has taken lot of preventive measure to control the
spread of the virus (Anon, 2020a). As the virus spreads due to the closer
interaction of the people the Government asked their citizens to
maintain Social Distancing. In March 22nd a one-day Janata Curfew, a
voluntary self-quarantine activity was observed nationwide. In March
24th, to stop the pandemic and for the welfare of the people, the
Honourable Prime Minister announced the 21 days Lockdown period
and imposed Section 144 of Cr.P.C. throughout the country (Anon,
2020f). By imposing this lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled
adversely without any further consequences. Also, the Government can
disinfect the public areas and allow the hospitals to prepare themselves
to handle this situation. Accordingly, any person who disobeys the rules
would be definitely punished.
1. Enforcement of law
The Constitution of India is considered to be the back bone of the
Government and all other laws laid down by the Government must not
be ultra vires with the constitution (Anon, 2020b). In case any law that
has been laid is ultra vires then it is considered to be unconstitutional
and not valid.
Article 19 of the Constitution of India states about the fundamental
rights of the Citizen, which include freedom of speech, freedom to go
anywhere in the country, form association or unions, gather at a public
place for a cause without any armour etc. but under certain emergency
and critical time there are certain exceptions to the fundamental rights
that are being exercised by the citizens of India, which are stated in
Article 19(2) to Article 19(6). Under this sub clause it is stated that the
state can impose any law for the welfare of the people in emergency
situation for example natural disaster etc. so it is our duty to follow the
rules and restrictions and restrictions that has been imposed.
There is a special act named Epidemic Disease Act 1897. This act
was specifically laid down for such emergency purposes. According to
this act the centre and state has the discretionary powers to take the
control in their hands to stop further spread of the disease or epidemic
or pandemic. Based on this act the centre and state have the power to
quarantine the people affected with any contagious disease or the
people who are suspected to have the symptoms of the contagious
disease. Or even healthy people to protect them from further spread of
the disease.
When the rules imposed by the government in reference to the
epidemic disease act are not followed properly then the Section 188 of
IPC comes into action. According to this section anyone who disobeys
the law imposed (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public
servant) is subjected to one month of imprisonment or fine of INR200 or
both on general conditions. If the person was the reason for the spread
of the disease to a healthy person or death of a person then he is subjected to imprisonment up to 6 months or fine of INR100 or both.
Disaster Management Act 2005 is another act that is related to the
current situation. Under this act Section 51 states the punishment for
the obstruction caused. According to this any person who disobeys the
rule imposed will be given one year of simple imprisonment and if the
person was responsible for any spread of disease or death then is subjected to imprisonment up to 2 years. Section 54 of the same act states
that if any person creates panic situation due to the spreading of false
information by any means e.g.; sharing any information in Social media
is subjected to imprisonment up to 1 year.

TAccording to the Section 270 of IPC which applies for a “malignant
act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life”. A violator
can be jailed for up to two years or could be fined or both without bail.
Under Section 271 of IPC if a person is tested positive or suspected
to be affected by the disease and are prescribed to be kept in quarantine
and any person who violates the quarantine rule are booked under this
section and imprisonment up to 2 years which is non cognizable.
According to the Essential Commodities Act, the essential commodities that are said to be the basic needs during the emergency and
disaster time must be sold at the price of MRP or at a reasonable cost
based on demand and requirement but selling the essential things at
unreasonable prices is said to be a crime and is subjected to imprisonment up to 7 years.
2. Psychological aspects of people during lockdown period
Due to lockdown, the psychological aspects of people are affected as
follows:
When the Government announces the India is going to be under
Lockdown in the next 4 h, the general public become panic. There was
an ambiguity among the common public whether the essential items
will be available and they started to buy items that are more than required and tried to store the commodities.
To reduce the fear of the Doctors, Nurses and other Healthcare
Workers the Government has declared Insurance for them. In order to
enhance Healthcare to the Nation, the service of the private Hospitals is
also leveraged. The Government is providing permission to setup more
testing facility to identify the infected people and for providing treatment. The MSME ministry has invited the manufacturer and supplier to
produce Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Ventilators, Medical
Equipment for the benefit of Healthcare Professionals and Public. Also,
various training programmes were organised for the healthcare professionals to handle the situation.
For the middle-class people, salaried people, organised sector etc.,
the RBI has reduced the repo rate which results in reduction in loan
interest rate. Also, for the term loans, the customer can opt out 3
months EMI. Also, ATM withdraw fee are waived off. Free LPG cylinders, Free rice / wheat, pulses are provided to the beneficiaries. The
deadlines for income tax returns has been extended. For the Small and
Medium Entrepreneurs, collateral free loans will be provided. The GST
filling dates has been extended.
During this lockdown period, the Migrant Workers were not able to
travel to their native place. To Leverage their fear, the Government has
instructed the Employers has to take care of the employees and to
provide them with food and shelter. The Government has instructed to
pay wages during the lockdown period for their employees. However,
three fourths of Indian population are working in unorganised sectors
and this lockdown may results in financial insecurity for them. Also, the
farmers got mentally stressed for the reason where there are no people
for harvesting their goods. The cultivated products like vegetables,
fruits, flowers, species etc cannot be exported to the foreign national
which will affect their economy.
UGC has issued some guidelines to Higher Education Institutes
(HEIs), to take care of the Mental Health, Psychosocial concerns & WellBeing of Students Community during and after COVID-19 outbreak
(Anon, 2020c). To address this challenge, the Teachers undertook the
Socially responsibility. To improvise the quality of teaching, ICT based
teaching-learning were adopted (Anon, 2020d). In order to keep the
Mental Wellness of the people, the National Institute of Mental Healthiness and Neuro Science has launched a toll-free telephone to counsel
the mental illness of people.
3. Conclusion
The corona outbreak is considered to be a pandemic. The Central
and State Government are taking many precautionary measures and
relief measures for the welfare of people. However, there are people
without unaware of the impact of Corona Virus, unnecessarily moving
around the streets. People become panic with the situation and buying
commodities needed without maintaining Social Distancing as advised
by Government. Without the public cooperation the spread of the virus
cannot be controlled. When the Government orders are violated, then
the Government has to strictly enforce the law. Thus, all are advised to
act wisely and cooperate with the Government to safe guard our lives
and the lives of other people.
Present situation conveys that “Law is the only Medicine (Sec.144 of
Cr.P.C.)”

A highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection, COVID-19, has dramatically
changed the world with a tragically large number of human lives being lost. The epidemic
has created psychological resilience and unbearable psychological pressure among
patients and health professionals. The objective of this study is to analyze investor
psychology and stock market behavior during COVID-19. The psychological behavior of
investors, whether positive or negative, toward the stock market can change the picture
of the economy. This research explores Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock
markets from January 20, 2020, to April 27, 2020, by employing principal component
analysis. The results showed that investor psychology was negatively related to three
selected stock markets under psychological resilience and pandemic pressure. The
negative emotions and pessimism urge investors to cease financial investment in the
stock market, and consequently, the stock market returns decreased. In a deadly
pandemic, the masses were more concerned about their lives and livelihood and less
about wealth and leisure. This research contributes to the literature gap of investors’
psychological behavior during a pandemic outbreak. The study suggests that policymakers should design a plan to fight against COVID-19. The government should
manage the health sector’s budget to overcome future crises.

INTRODUCTION
The terminology of “Corona” is not newly invented in science. This single-stranded RNA
virus’ primary roots were observed in 1960, belonging to the Corona viridae family in the
order Nidovirales (Galante et al., 2016; Kanwar et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2020; Mohsin et al.,
2020b). The taxonomic naming comes from the virus’ structure, which gives the appearance
of crown-like spikes on the virus’ outer surface (Azam et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020c;
Shereen et al., 2020). The prey of the first coronavirus species was chicken and pig; there
was no human–human transmission. From 1960 to 2020, different allied versions of the
same family of viruses have been observed: the common cold in adults (COV 229E and
COV OC43 in mid-1960); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2003);
human coronavirus with common cold, bronchitis, and asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary

disease (COPD) exacerbations; pneumonia (HCOV NL63-2004
and CoV-HKU1); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS
CoV-2012); and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus19 (SARS-CoV-2019 or SARS-CoV-2), displaying unmatched
intensity and severity compared to the previous species of corona
(Van Der Hoek et al., 2004; Kahn and McIntosh, 2005; Woo
et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2006; Zaki et al., 2012). At the start
of the virus breakout, the virus name was 2019-nCOV as per
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),
and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CCDC) changed it into SARS-CoV-2 on January 7, 2020 due to
its structure and symptoms. COVID-19 was first discovered in
Wuhan’s wet market, Hubei Province, China, in early December
2019, and this aroused global attention in late January 2020.
The virus has been spreading exponentially, using human-tohuman transmission through respiratory droplets, i.e., sneezing
and coughing (Azam et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al.,
2020a; Shereen et al., 2020). During this incubation period,
researchers focused on exploring, preventing, and treating
patients. Still, the pandemic’s psychological impact is the other
side of the disease (mental illness). The global quarantine
announcement has sparked several concerns: fear of separation
from family, fear of illness and death, avoidance of medical
facilities due to threat of infection, fear of unemployment, the
threat of racism against people who live in or are perceived
to be from the affected areas, fear of losing near and dear
ones because of the virus, maintained space from minors
and disabled or elderly family members due to infection,
isolation, and recalling the severity of the treatment of infected
people. These have become originators of anxiety, stress, and
grave concern globally. These mental health aspects of the
COVID-19 outbreak have affected individual lives as well as the
financial markets.
Human Psychology and COVID-19
The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has seriously influenced
human psychology through a notable mental state of “anxiety.”
The term “anxiety” covers the population’s reaction toward the
epidemic to all media, whether the information is authentic
or erroneous, e.g., inappropriate behavior of people concerning
the abandonment of animals and panic buying of other foods.
The panic attacks are not properly defined without linkage to
anxiety disorder in the medical sense. Anxiety is a combination
of different psychiatric disorders both internal (phobias, panic
attacks, and panic disorder) and external (worry, stress, fear,
painful experiences, or events). The psychological effect of
COVID-19’ has led to mass hysteria, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The behavioral
immune system (BIS) theory, stress theory, and perceived risk
theory explain that negative emotion (anxiety, aversion) and
negative cognitive assessment of human beings are developed
for self-protection. People tend to develop avoidant behavior
and strictly follow the social norms due to the pandemic’s
severe effects and the potential threat of disease (Cao et al.,
2020; Lai et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020b). The anxiety, stress,
and panic attacks of people due to COVID-19 have created
two etiologies. The first is the identification of symptoms of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as cough
and dyspnea, at high frequency (Preter and Klein, 2008;
Javelot and Weiner, 2020). The second one is “false alarming”
(Klein, 1993) as a psychopathological link to the catastrophic

interpretation of physiological sensation (respiration rate). The
recurrence of panic attacks has increased the respiration rate
and has become the reason for excessively avoidant behaviors
and blind conformity (Li et al., 2020; Mohsin et al., 2020a).
Psychopathology is a keen concern for this study because it has
an intense effect on investor behavior. Stock market investors
and business people generally spend most of their time in the
workplace. However, they are currently mostly homebound;
the present situation of the stock markets, investment decision
pressure, and family members’ psychological health now put
pressure on investor psychology.
Investors’ Psychology (Sentiments),
Stock Market, and COVID-19
The COVID-19 outbreak has threatened every individual
field of life to influence public health. The sustainability of
the global stock market and financial markets also carries
significant repercussions (Ali et al., 2020; Huang and Zheng,
2020). Being a part of the societal system, investor psychology
(sentiments) and their optimism or pessimism about future stock
prices can also change. A sharp decrease has been observed
in Shanghai, Dow Jones, and Nikkei’s stock prices due to
investor sentiment volatility during the pandemic outbreak (see
Figure 1). The visual presentation of Figure 1 has shown a
sudden downward trend in stock markets after the outbreak
of the pandemic.
Existing literature has focused on the relationship between
stock prices and investor sentiment. Lee et al. (2002) and Brown
and Cliff (2004) explained that the past market returns are
important sentiment determinants, while investor sentiment
changes significantly correlated with the contemporary
market return. The positive relationship between stock
markets and sentiment will confirm that investor sentiment
is a contrarian predictor for consequent market returns.
Meanwhile, the sentiment impact is stronger if easy (hard)
to value stocks are negatively (positively) influenced by
sentiments (Baker and Wurgler, 2007; Xiang et al., 2020).
Using the component of market index return, which is
avoidant of fundamental macroeconomic factors, Lan et al.
(2020) observed robust evidence that the pre-announcement
abnormal return derives from investor sentiment. The sentiment
determined overvaluation corrects within 1 month in the postannouncement period. The market timers tackle this sentiment
situation and take advantage of issuing season shares. The
stock price sensitivity in terms of the good news of earning is
higher during a high sentiment period. In contrast, in a low
sentiment period, the stock price sensitivity behaves negatively.
As per analysis suggestions, the investor sentiment becomes
the reason for the general mispricing of stock because of
sentient-driven mispricing of earning contributions (Schmeling,
2009; Zouaoui et al., 2011; Mian and Sankaraguruswamy, 2012;
Cheema et al., 2020). The high market competition indicated
that sentiments and returns are positively related to each other,
and this relationship disappears in low market competition.
Although the financial crisis changes the situation irrespective
of market competition, a positive relationship exists between
sentiments and returns (Ryu et al., 2020). Investors can accept
psychological pressure more sensitively and intensively than
the lay person. Apart from the pandemic’s rapid spread, the
financial news, media, and amplifiers have worked as fear
spreaders about COVID-19. Tetlock (2007) elucidated that
spread of news about the stock market strongly affects investor
psychology and sociology. The high media pessimism leads to
downward pressure on market prices and vice versa. The investor
sentiment theory also confirmed the consistent relationship
between media content and individual investor behavior with
disproportionately small stocks. This research is based on a
new ideology of investor psychology and the stock market
during the pandemic. There have been few studies in this area,
but a bulk of research centers on both human psychology
and COVID-19 as well as the stock market and COVID-19.
Under the caption of investor psychology, the stock market,
and COVID-19, we tried to explain this research’s nature
and relationship.
The psychological pressure negatively impacts investors and
investing decisions, which can decline any individual country’s
economy. This study analyzed investor psychology and stock
market behavior during COVID-19—a comparatively new debate
about COVID-19. This research will contribute to the existing
literature and open up new dimensions in understanding
investor sentiment toward investment decisions in the stock

market under special circumstances during the outbreak of
pandemics and times of intense anxiety. Our research differs
from previous studies in the use of proxies of investor
sentiment as indicators of the stock market and COVID-19.
The strong theoretical upbringing of psychological behavior and
the dynamic process of stock price fluctuation will deepen the
understanding of readers, investors, and researchers. A sample
of three different stock markets will help elaborate on investors’
psychological and geographical sensation during investment
decisions in a pandemic.
DATA DESCRIPTION AND
METHODOLOGY
Data Description
Our research includes daily observations of three different stock
markets, i.e., Shanghai stock market, Nikkei, and Dow Jones,
from January 20 to April 27, 2020. The market selection is based
on two reasons. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on investor
sentiment during the pandemic, i.e., the Shanghai Stock Market
(China). The second is to check the global impact by using Nikkei
and Dow Jones. The reason behind the selected data span is the
global spread of COVID-19. The sample period starts from the
data declaration of all sample markets because the synchronized
data lead to accurate results. The data are collected from stock
markets in China, Japan, and the United States. The analyzed data
are secondary and publically available on mentioned databases,
i.e., Bloomberg for stock markets data and WHO for COVID-19.
Methodology
The Sentiment Index (SMI) model used in this research is

Stock Exchange Turnover Ratio
The stock market’s trading activity can be measured by turnover
ratio; subsequently, it is used in the primary measurement model.
Ying (1966) and Rehman et al. (2017) have explained that more
considerable turnover is an indication of a rise in stock prices
(Bullish Market), while small turnover reflects a fall in stock
prices (Bearish Market). The stock exchange turnover ratio is
calculated by using the following equation:
STURN = 100 ×
VMDaily
VMMonthly
(2)
where VMDaily is used for daily volume, VMMonthly is the average
volume of the month, and STURN is calculated using a running
or moving basis, which means the previous dropping value and
adding the next one.
Money Flow Index
The MFI comprises daily stock prices and turnover information.
An increase in money flow indicates the market trend. The

whereas the rise in the falling trend increases the selling
pressure. The following formula is used to calculate
the MFI:

Money Flow = Daily Prices × Turnover (4)
When the current day price is higher than the previous day,
the money flow is positive, while there is a comparatively
lower current day price than the previous day, the money
flow is negative (Tolonen, 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Marek
and Marková, 2020). The daily MFI has been calculated as
follows:
MFI =

Relative Strength Index
The technical analysis used the RSI, a momentum indicator that
measures the magnitude of recent price changes, to evaluate
the oversold or overbought condition in stock or other asset
prices (Russell, 1978; Wilder, 1978; Russell and Franzmann,
1979; Ivascu and Cioca, 2019). An oscillator is a display board
of RSI between two extremes (low and high with a range
of 0–100). Suppose the oscillator shows an upward trend
with RSI ≥ 70 value, meaning that a security is overbought
or overvalued. In that case, a positive but downward trend
with RSI ≤ 30 value indicates an oversold or undervalued
condition.

The changes in daily confirmed and death cases of COVID19 are used to capture investor mood swings regarding
the spreading pandemic. This term was used by Chen
et al. (2010, 2014) to check the impact of market index

Relationship Between Stock Market Index and
Investor Sentiment
The SMI regressed on the stock market volatility series during
COVID-19. The following regression equation checks the
respective sentiment and market return relationship:
Ym,t−1,i = α + βlnSMIm,t−1,i (9)
Ym,t−1 is the market return of the stock market’s indicator
concerning time, while SMIm,t−1,i
is the Sentiment Index. The
calculation of Ym,t−1 is done by the following equation:
Rm,t,i = 100 ∗ Log 

In this equation, Pt
is the current market price (closing), and Pt−1
is the preceding market price (closing).
RESULTS
Principle Component Analysis
The principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to extract
meaningful information from multivariate data (orthogonal
linear transformation) and present the information in the form
of a set of new variables by use of scalar projections, which are
called principal components (PC). The total number of PCs is
less than or equal to the original number of variables. That is
why the new variables or PCs are known as a linear combination

of actual variables. The PCs are used as direction identifiers and
correspond to the total variation of the data set. The multivariate
data dimensionality reduces by using PCA with minimal loss of
information. The eigenvalues explained that every PC retains the
amount of variation. The division of variation between PCs as
the eigenvalues is large for first PCs and small for subsequent
ones. The first PC, or the PC with more than one eigenvalue, was
used to check the correlation because of the increased variation
retention of the data set.
Shanghai Stock Market
The principal component analysis of the selected variable for the
Shanghai Stock Market is presented in Tables 1, 2. According to
Kaiser Criterion, the principle component with an eigenvalue not
less than 1 will be used (Yeomans and Golder, 1982; Braeken
and Van Assen, 2017; Rehman et al., 2017). The eigenvalue of
PC-1 is 2.0545, which meets the criteria of maximal variation.
The numeric presentation of PC-1 shows 41.09% of the Shanghai
Stock Market relationship, which is the highest value compared
to other principal components. The following index was created
by using the first principle component:
SMISSE,t = −0.0584STURN + 0.1759MFI + −0.1244RSI +
0.68811CC + 0.69041CD
The relationship between Shanghai stock returns and the
created SMI is graphically presented in Figure 2.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 3, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The multicollinearity check is essential for the accuracy
of results because inter-correlation among independent variables
in a multiple regression model can mislead the results. When
the regressor shows a value of more than 0.80, then the data
series shows multicollinearity. The correlation matrix range for
the Shanghai Stock Market is from −0.0991 to 0.8018, ensuring
the data series is free from multicollinearity.

Nikkei 225 Stock Market
The PCA of the selected variable for the Nikkei 225 stock market
is presented in Tables 4, 5. According to Kaiser Criterion, the
principle component with an eigenvalue not less than 1 will be
used (Yeomans and Golder, 1982; Braeken and Van Assen, 2017;
Rehman et al., 2017). The eigenvalue of PC-1 for the Nikkei
225 stock market is 1.8735, which captures maximum variation
and gets the full support of Kaiser Criterion. The cumulative
proportion value of PC-1 shows 37.47% of the Nikkei 225 stock
market relationship with a set of selected variables. The following
index was created by using the first principle component:
SMIN225,t = 0.6844STURN + −0.1786MFI + −0.6003RSI
+ − 0.13801CC + 0.34691CD
The relationship of Shanghai stock returns and created SMI is
graphically presented in Figure 3.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 6, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The range of correlation matrix for the Nikkei 225
stock market is between −0.0991 and 0.8008, which rejects the
existence of multicollinearity.
Dow Jones Stock Market
The PCA of the selected variable for the Dow Jones stock market
is presented in Tables 7, 8. The eigenvalue of PC-1 is 1.7291,

cumulative proportion value of PC-1 shows 34.58% of the Dow
Jones stock market relationship with chosen variables, which is
the highest value among all principal components. The following
index was created using the first principle component:
SMIDJ,t = −0.2275STURN + −0.1650MFI − 0.1960RSI
+0.67981CC + 0.64841CD
The relationship between Dow Jones stock returns and the
created SMI is graphically presented in Figure 4.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 9, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The importance of multicollinearity is observed
because inter-correlation among independent variables in a
multiple regression model can betray the results. The range of
the correlation matrix for the Dow Jones stock market is from
−0.0367 to 0.6135, which guarantees the data series free from
multicollinearity.
The regression results are presented in Table 10, which
shows the coefficient (β) −0.2532, −0.2532, and −0.0264 as the
value of the SMI with 0.0056, 0.0056, and 0.0000 probability
values for Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock markets,
respectively. According to this study, the SMI is negative and
significantly related to stock returns at a 1% level of significance
(Baker and Wurgler, 2007; Chen et al., 2014). The importance
of SMI explicated that investor sentiments are strongly affected
by volatility and investment decision of the stock market during
the pandemic. The results have also shown the negative impact of
COVID-19 on investor sentiment and stock market returns. The
spreading pandemic disturbs the general public’s daily routines
and interrupts stock markets, financial markets, and investor
psychology toward investment decisions.
DISCUSSION
After the pandemic outbreak and the WHO’s classification of it
as a public health emergency, investors’ psychological pressure

and response showed a downward trend in stock markets. The
sudden reduction in Shanghai (1.6%), Dow and Jones (9.5%),
and Nikkei (10.6%) can be observed in Figure 1. The numerical
facts of stock markets are collected from Bloomberg’s official
site, and the investor sentiment is generated using different
proxies. The selected proxies represent different circumstances
that might be affected the psychological behavior and decision
power of investors. In this research, daily data of stock markets
and increase in COVID-19 (death and confirmed cases) are
used, accurately covering investors’ daily psychological pressure.
The PCA is employed due to its useful features: correlation
removal, improved algorithm performance, repaired overfitting
among variables, and reduction of high dimensions into low
dimensions for clear visualization of every single component. The
research results elucidated a negative and significant relationship
between investor psychology and investment decision under
pandemic outbreaks for all selected markets. The stock market
movement along the investor SMI in Figures 2–4 has shown
the beneficial relationship between investor psychology and
stock market returns. The investors or business people were
generally outbound for 10–15 h per day. During pandemic,
however, they were homebound, which affected their psychology
adversely. This research provides some precautionary measures
for releasing the pandemic and investment pressure. Investors
should adopt behavior therapy—home-based relaxation exercises
to control their anxiety and depression. The small-scale version
of their official stock market setup should be established in their
homes, and visits to the offices should be reduced. The global
paramedical staff and scientists are continually struggling to
elucidate the vaccines. Until they succeed, everyone should follow
the precautions, i.e., wearing a mask, sanitizing, and maintaining
distance in workplaces and the like. The less psychological control
or pressure can help investors invest money and keep stock
markets and economies on track.
CONCLUSION
The origin of the current “COVID-19” pandemic is considered
to be the wet market of Hunan, Hubei Province, China. Within
1 month from its evolution, COVID-19 has spread to 109
countries, and the pandemic has gained intense global attention.
The sudden outbreak of the pandemic and the rapid increase of
its spread have left a significant impact on human physiology and
psychology. The psychological effect disrupts the psychology of
the general public and investor psychology toward stock market
investment decisions. The increasing number of cases and deaths
worldwide due to COVID-19 has made the economic situation
more uncertain and unpredictable. A sudden and dramatic
downward trend in financial markets is observed in Chinese
and global financial markets, such as Shanghai, Nikkei 225,
and Dow Jones, which are down by −1.6, 10.6, and −9.5%
points, respectively. There are no promising clinical treatments
or prevention strategies developed against COVID-19 until now,
threatening human psychology. At the same time, healthcare
workers are searching for a solution to the question of vaccination
against COVID-19 and psychiatrist-designed psycho-therapeutic
strategies to cope with the threat, stress, and anxiety of the
pandemic, which have a devastating effect on daily life.
This research paper examined the relationship between the
stock market and investor psychology regarding stock market
investment decisions during the pandemic. By employing PCA,
this research observed a downward trend in stock markets
and the pandemic’s negative impact on investor sentiment.
This investigation confirmed the economic crises in the
Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock markets during
the pandemic. The results have pointed out that the threat of
health strongly affected the psychology of investors. The created
SMI behaved negatively with a significance of 1% for three
selected markets. The three selected markets represented three
different world areas with diverse geographical backgrounds,
financial positions, cultures, resources, and traditions to check
global investor behavior. The significant relationship between
the SMI and the stock market during a pandemic confirmed
that the behavior of almost every nation fighting COVID-19
and investor financial behavior is the same across China and
other developed countries. This study concluded that health
crises and psychological disorders among the general public affect
the economic condition and financial position of individual and
global investors.
Limitations and Suggestions
The pandemic is still under discussion, and healthcare workers
are trying to find a solution to the issue of vaccination. It is

doubtlessly tough to run global systems, such as the stock market,
from the workers’ individual homes, but to stop working due
to anxiety or psychological threat is also not the solution to
the problem. Investor sentiment creates tremendous uncertainty
for stock markets and commensurate with a potential crisis of
scale and speed. The governments and policy-makers should
have to set some domestic and international policies for this
unpredictable situation for workplaces. The pandemic is a
worldwide issue, but the courageous actions of governments,
global citizens, policy-makers, healthcare workers, scientists, and
investors can enable us to overcome this global crisis.

Sport psychology services to professional athletes: working
through COVID-19
Fandom around the world yearns for sports entertainment. Much of the discussions within the
recent flurry of sport and exercise psychology writings have been focused on the challenging
experiences of potential Olympians during an Olympic year. Indeed, the 2020 Olympics is an
entertainment event like few others across sport levels.
Within a previous editorial titled “Sport Psychology Services to High-Performance Athletes
During Covid-19”, our Co-Editors from the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology
invited several renowned experts from the international amateur sport community to join us in
a dialog regarding how amatuer athletes from various national teams experienced their journeys through COVID-19. The editorial revealed convergences, though also idiosyncrasies in
how team training during the time of the pandemic has been undertaken within centralised
programs. The recent Olympic editorial can be found at the following link: https://doi.org/10.
1080/1612197X.2020.1754616.
The International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology is committed to advancing open
dialogs regarding all forms of sport and physical activity. The intention is to contribute to a
healthier world, through better evidence-based theory to practice. The IJSEP continues to
welcome all authors seeking to contribute to COVID-19 discussions to submit their scholarship,
emphasising the impacts of the pandemic on sport and physical activity participants, as well as
those who support them with psychological services.
Within this editorial, we have shifted our gaze to professional sport. Professional sport,
unlike Olympic sport, is accessible to viewership every year. There are a vast number of professional team and individual sports that attract viewership, whilst inspiring populations
within and across national boundaries. Akin to our recently aforementioned editorial, the
current editorial is accessible to you for free. Our composition of authorship in this editorial
is also diverse in sport representation. Given the large number of professional sports known
within our global community, the current contributors were narrowed to experts with vast
experience working in professional baseball (MLB – Charles Maher), golf (PGA, LPGA – Rich
Gordin), basketball (NBPA – William Parham), cricket (Stewart Cotterill), soccer (NFA –
Carsten Hvid Larsen), and one of our editors, who is actively involved in combat sport
(boxing, mixed martial arts, kick boxing – Robert Schinke). These experts have collaborated
to augment wider perspectives about professional sport athletes in a pandemic.
The contributors consider their recent and current approaches in active work with professional sport clients, following a sequence: (a) once professional sporting events stopped,
(b) current approaches in their work with professional athletes, and (c) a brief, broader reflection. What we hope the reader will find is that both temporal stages and the final conclusion
indicate growth opportunities for consultants and professional sport clients, alike. One of the
contributors was recently in a multisport mental performance consultant video session, and
a participant suggested that the current state of affairs in relation to elite athletes is being
experienced primarily as a tragic loss. Such a narrative might tell part of how athletes regard
the current moment in their careers, but it does not tell the full story, or for that matter, a

https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2020.1766182mentally healthy story of the opportunities and teachable moments before us. We draw on the
structure directly above to inform the narrative of this editorial.
Emergence of the pandemic
During mid-March 2020, professional sports around the world were in preparation and performance scheduling. Sport as business took an immediate turn, with imminent closures and
the inability for athletes, coaches, managers, and mental performance consultants to continue
their onsite roles within their organisations. Our contributors were involved in developing (a)
action plans to accomplish the closure of training settings; (b) communicating the delicate
decision of closure to players and staff, who were well aware that their seasons were trending
toward a stoppage; and (c) for those who were working in cities away from their families, providing clients with health and safety travel guidelines as they made arrangements to return to
their home residences.
The ripple effect of an abrupt stoppage, or crisis transition, is known to leave athletes and
coaches with psychological and emotional challenges. At a population level, where athletes are
included, there are increased cases in domestic violence, suicide, and bigotry. One highly publicised challenge we understand is that each athlete is unique in her/his engagement with
social isolation. Though challenges with social distancing have been encountered worldwide,
much has been written in cultural sport psychology identifying variations in collective and individual approaches within and across cultures. Certain cultures and nationalities are formal in
terms of socially accepted distance, where people other than close family naturally maintain
extensive physical distance, such as six feet. There are also Hispanic and Latino cultures
where social exchanges are encountered at a closer physical distance, where people are normally demonstrative through hugs and kisses with friends and colleagues, beyond family
(Schinke, Hanrahan, & Catina, 2009). We cannot assume that even in a single Major League
Baseball franchise, professional boxing management group, cricket, or soccer team, that all athletes have experienced the required transition to formal cultural distance in the same way.
Some are more comfortable and some are ill at ease with social distancing.
Based on what we know from athlete identity research and practice, and our own
practical exposures, high-performance athletes, amateur and professional alike, emphasise
their athletic identities. Within professional sport, there are individual differences in terms of
how much emphasis is placed on an athletic identity as compared to the number of identities
that comprise one’s personhood. Many of our clients have families and partners, and some
have side businesses and enterprises. However, we do recognise that professional athletes
derive gainful employment from their sporting activities. Consequently the emphasis on an
athletic identity is often heavily weighted, perhaps disproportionately. Due to any athlete’s
long-term commitment to sport excellence at the highest level, some players rarely explore
other roles and contexts and, as a result, suffer from identity foreclosure and an overly
narrow, singular identity (Nesti & Littlewood, 2011), which is counter-productive during a pandemic due to social isolation.
The challenges that flow from an overly weighted athletic identity, then, can include
increased possibilities of anxiety, depression, addictions, and other mental health concerns
(Henriksen, Schinke, Moesch, McCann, Parham, Larsen & Terry, 2019). Exemplifying our point,
between March 22 and April 14, the percentage of professional soccer players reporting symptoms of depression doubled. FIFPRO and affiliated national player associations surveyed 1602
professional soccer players in countries that had implemented drastic measures to contain the
spread of the COVID-19 such as home-confinement. One thousand one hundred and thirty-four
male players, with a mean age of 26, and 468 female players, with a mean age of 23, took part in
410 EDITORIALthe survey. Twenty-two percent of women players and 13 percent of men players reported
symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Eighteen percent of the women and
16 percent of the men reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of generalised
anxiety (FIFPRO, 2020).
Just as there are identity challenges associated with a pandemic, like every other unforeseen
transition, there exist possibilities for personal enrichment. A pause for thought, albeit, in this
case a lengthier one than first might have been anticipated, is often assumed to be inertia in a
motivated, goal-directed athlete. The holistic opportunities for growth abound in such
moments. Time away from extensive and longstanding training commitments and travel
afford professional athletes time to develop their personal identities, existing relationships,
and explore a breadth of interests, beyond sport. The immediate pause was an opportunity
to nourish relationships, whilst nourishing one’s self.
Counterbalanced with the opportunity to reconnect has been for some, a recognition that
their playing contracts in the short-term were in peril. For example, a boxer is compensated
after each bout – no bouts, no income. With younger professionals who were less financially
heeled, discussions related to financial constraints layered on a further dimension of stress.
Several of the younger athletes with lesser contracts returned home and are presently residing
with parents or extended family. There is a second group of athletes we identified that are presently living alone. These athletes are even more socially isolated than those surrounded by
family members. Finally, athletes on the cusp of financial independence, with young families
of their own, continue to struggle as they await loosened restrictions and the inevitable reconceptualisation of what professional training and subsequent sporting events will be like, with
fewer fans in seats. Questions linger among athletes in terms of interruptions to existing career
paths, and associated, their financial livelihood. These questions could apply more deeply to
athletes residing in developing countries, where finances are perhaps, less available.
Current interventions
There is consensus among the authors that in order to work effectively with clients, we have
needed to develop an organic approach. The logical question we all have asked the athletes
is what exactly they are looking for in terms of support during this pandemic moment.
Some initially were uncertain in terms of how to respond to such an open-ended approach,
enveloped in an unfamiliar circumstance – COVID-19. These athletes now reside at home,
they are not among their peers, and they do need to feel that they are trending positively in
terms of their athletic careers. What follows are a few approaches we have integrated into
our work; some sport specific, some holistic. These approaches have been undertaken
through online means, such as the regular use of video platforms, and chat discussions and
forums with individuals and teams.
Our work is founded on the premise that athletes will best relate to structured communication and contact. Athletes, akin to all high-performance career professionals, evolve based
on logical short- and long-term plans. Their career pathways need to make sense, and each
needs to flow logically toward outcomes that can be parlayed into improved, consistent performance and viability into the future. The accountability in terms of planning must rest
with each athlete in terms of thoughts, emotions, and actions. When an athlete is invested
in self-improvement, he/she will allocate and schedule regular times within each week to
work on one’s mental game. Rarely is there the time to reflect with the guidance of a
mental performance consultant, perhaps in collaboration with a coaching staff member, to
identify existing gaps, and derive short-term plans that will compliment existing strengths.
Weekly scheduled small group discussions with key support staff members, followed by
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY 411individual sessions with key providers, will lead to advancement in player development. Hence,
the immediate time at home can become treasured, not only in terms of what it offers personally and interpersonally but also in terms of unanticipated – newfound gains in sport-specific
skills.
Underlying regular support is an opportunity for the mental performance consultant to
forge a strengthened relationship with each athlete. During pre-season and in season, athletes
are focused on securing their positions, the immediacy of performance, and collaborating with
coaches and teammates. Proactive sport psychology work is often associated with player
access – something that can become challenging and scarce in professional sport. Alternately,
assigned tasks are often reactionary, based on immediate setbacks or struggles. During the
current moment, there is time to become further acquainted with each athlete’s uniqueness
as a person, and then, in terms of how that person comes forth to training and competition.
Reciprocally, the athlete has the time to learn about the mental performance consultant, in
terms of discussions around values and where and how the athlete’s gaps might coincide
with the practitioner’s skills. The work that ensues is then deepened through mutual understanding and a strengthened relationship, leading into the future and the anticipated return
to play.
The specifics that underpin each mental performance consultant’s work will vary depending
on each athlete’s needs and the path that is set toward valued progression(s). We have undertaken exercises focused on mindfulness, guided performance imagery, the re-setting of goals,
revisiting of competition plans, affirmation exercises, and broader holistic life balance and
values- related discussions. We have also engaged with groups of athletes, sometimes spanning sport organisations, where they are able to facilitate a sharing of their current experiences,
and the recognition that they are not alone in their career challenges. Peers are undergoing
similar challenges, which contributes to a recognition that each athlete is still among peers,
just from a virtual distance.
The path forward
There is hidden inspiration in the words that athletes, coaching staff, and mental performance
consultants have expressed since COVID-19. We find ourselves working in a positive direction,
for the betterment of sport as part of life. Each author identified above plays a part in how performances are being played out. Performances on the field are most often the end product of
active work and inspirations in a series of opportune moments. The most profound net gain has
been the strengthening of existing relationships within the athletes’ lives, in their personal and
professional spheres. Mental performance consultants often affirm that these relationships
serve as the basis of client engagement, contributing to sporting excellence. The current
time is historical, perhaps in more ways than people have envisioned. We are curious of new
ways to further human potential. The answers might be atypical based on how we previously
went about our roles as mental performance consultants. Atypical approaches can be healthy
and contributive to excellence, founded in ingenuity. We predict that the best in
professional sport performance is yet to come, and much of that progress will be gleaned
from the current pandemic moment, assuming time, for athletes and providers alike, is used
wisely.

The COVID-19 pandemic may affect the world severely in terms of quality of life, political,
environmental, and economic sustainable development, and the global economy. Its
impact is attested to by the number of research studies on it. The main aim of this study
is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of sustainability (quality of
life), on sustainable development, and on the global economy. A computerized literature
search was performed, and journal articles from authentic sources were extracted,
including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald
Insight. The references in selected articles were screened to identify any relevant studies.
The following inclusion criteria were followed: research articles based on the COVID19 pandemic, and articles, research papers, journals, and news articles published
2010 to 2020. The exclusion criteria were as follow: psychology research, articles, and
journals published before 2010 and research articles having no link with the current
pandemic’s impact on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global
economy. Of the initial 350 articles identified, only 61 studies were found to be relevant
and meet the inclusion criteria. Based on these articles, the review highlights that
compared to developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as
African countries with compromised health structures have been greatly affected. There
are close associations between health, economic, environmental, and political issues
globally. The pandemic can be managed if we follow new policies that implement
economic and public health changes worldwide. A planned, coordinated approach
between the public-private sector is required, designed according to each country’s
health system and economy. We can come out of this crisis if we work together and
support both developed and developing nations.

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
INTRODUCTION
There is a high rate of uncertainty related to COVID-19, whose
pandemic impacts economic performance, sustainability criteria,
and development processes. Haider et al. (2020) mention the
effect of coronavirus on health and economic crises. Analysis
of its growth in countries, clearly shows that its development
leads to crises. Declining GDP rates damage health, education,
and industrial progress globally. According to Herbert (2020),
COVID-19 affects socio-economic circumstances because of
declining global GDP, declining capital flows, fewer investment
opportunities, and decreased trading. Not limited to economic
loss, this pandemic impacts social parameters like the changes
in sustainable psychological development. Globally, the rate
of poverty is increasing. The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) World Economic Update for June estimated considerable
fluctuation in the final ratios (IMF, 2020).
More than 20 million people currently live in extreme
poverty; however, Mukhtar (2020) reports that an increase of
about 420 million is projected to be living in extreme poverty.
Findings gathered by the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) reflect that COVID-19 has resulted in a
severe decline in human development for the first time since 1990
(Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020). Their examination reveals that the
current global picture lacks socio-economic development. These
issues and challenges directly affect an individual’s psychology
and assure them of a loss of psychological sustainability and the
addition of financial crises. Specifically, with many risks affecting
the public, cases of mental crises are increasing (Kang et al., 2019).
As a result of people being restricted to their homes and being
asked to maintain self-isolation, there is a high chance of someone
being severely affected psychologically, which is further impacted
by the lack of accurate guidelines or treatment.
When no resources are provided to manage people’s wellbeing, the situation, including pandemic prevention measures,
is reframed and affects psychological health. Concerning the
impact on sustainable psychology, Bai et al. (2020) discuss
the importance of improved mental health because it affects
individual growth and counters restricted personal activities.
The authorities’ actions and management criteria for regulating
the pandemic are beyond people’s control but adversely impact
their exercising, eating habits, gardening, dancing, meditation,
learning, and other activities. As a result, people perceive the
negative impact on their minds, and the sustainability of their
psychological health is damaged (Yao et al., 2020). In the view
of Li et al. (2020), COVID-19 impacts the quality of life and
mental health as it prejudices human living standards. The joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2020) notes
that this pandemic increases the numbers of people suffering
from stress and anxiety, conditions that are related to depression.
Thus, it is essential to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of
COVID-19 from the perspective of quality of life and economic,
psychological, and environmental perspectives.
Several research studies have highlighted the severe impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. It is worth noting that the 2013 SARS
outbreak experienced in Hong Kong damaged mental health
(Fernandes, 2020), but, specific to COVID-19, there are diverse
effects on mental health following the imposition of preventive
measures. Social distancing, self-isolation, limited meetings, and
lack of interaction directly decelerate the economy and mental
health. Many countries face declining projected global trade and
export volumes. In the view of Allcott et al. (2020), psychological
sustainability involves the merger of political perspectives,
human development, and economic aspects, and COVID-19 has
had an impact on all three. Fetzer et al. (2020) discuss the
pandemic’s impact on the global economy as self-isolation results
in loss of business revenue. Restrictions on consumers being
able to purchase ultimately result in an economic downturn.
Apart from this, stresses are being constantly imposed on
people worldwide that negatively affect their minds and decrease
economic activity (Iacus et al., 2020). COVID-19’s considerable
impact has emotionally traumatized individuals; the handling
of the situation has reduced their level of comfort, socially,
economically, and environmentally, according to Cartwright
et al. (2020). The amalgamation of these factors triggers a
high level of stress in people’s minds, which, meanwhile, affects
economic development, as it ruins efforts for developmental
projects (Pirouz et al., 2020).
We have faced several epidemics in the past. Asian nations
were impacted by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS
outbreak), and West Africa was under the attack by the Ebola
virus. They also influenced the socio-economic equilibrium,
affected public health, and caused numerous deaths similar to
what we are facing with COVID-19 (Marin, 2018; Lawanson and
Evans, 2019). The pandemic has affected all types of businesses.
There are shortages of medical equipment such as masks and
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), etc. It has made us realize
how fragile our systems are and that no country can face this crisis
on its own. A targeted and collaborative approach is required.
The main aim of this current research is to evaluate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sustainability of the
quality of life, i.e., how people are tending toward stress, anxiety,
depression, and other health/mental issues. Not limited to this
alone, the study discusses the pandemic’s impact on sustainable
development psychologically and economically. Given that
changes in psychological sustainability link with people’s living
style, and how they deal with their life situations, there is a
need to conduct a study in this direction. Currently, there are
reports and research articles that separately discuss the impact of
COVID-19’s rapid spread on the health system, mental health,
sustainability, and the global economy (Allcott et al., 2020;
Banerjee, 2020; Pirouz et al., 2020). Research related to the
pandemic’s simultaneous effects on the psychological, economic,
and environmental paradigms is required. That is why this
study explores information about and human experiences that
influence their quality of life psychologically, economically, and
environmentally.
Due to the pandemic, trade has also been largely affected. The
impact of this chaos will have a long-term effect on globalization.
All private and public sectors are under its influence (Donald,
2020). Previously, all large companies had goals focused only on
financial gain. However, now the level of interconnected trade
has lost its meaning. There has been an unequal distribution
of the benefits associated with globalization (Roome, 2011).

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
The more powerful governments and those who own major
conglomerations should realize that unless we work together, the
overall quality of life will be compromised globally. Working
culture and environment and the worker’s s policies should
be looked into to obtain a flexible, innovative, and empathetic
workplace for everyone to deal with this crisis.
Therefore, the aim of this research report is to:
• Analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
sustainability of quality of life
• Determine the effect of the COVID-19 on the economic,
social, and political factors relating to the sustainable
development environment
• Evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
global economy
• Examine the organizational changes and solutions for
dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and
• Highlight the effect of support of the world trade
environmental infrastructure in tackling the condition of
COVID-19.
METHODOLOGY
Study Design
All the guidelines and principles were followed while preparing
the methodology for this research. A thorough literature search
was conducted, and after proper evaluation and analysis, relevant
literature was identified and included for the present review.
To accomplish the desired objectives, all the studies related to
the topic published from Jan 2010 to June 2020 were selected. It
was assumed that including some publications of the previous
decade would be helpful in reflecting upon the practices and
strategies that were implemented in situations previously like
the global economic recession A computerized literature search
was performed and journal articles from authentic sources
were extracted, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar,
Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald Insight. The References
in the selected articles were screened to identify any relevant
studies. The literature search was performed by including the
following keywords: “Coronavirus” OR “pandemic” OR “SARSCoV-2” OR “COVID-19” OR “sustainability” OR “quality of
life” OR “Global economy” OR “psychology and Organizational
changes and COVID-19.”
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were: research articles based on the
COVID-19 pandemic and articles, research papers, journals,
and news articles published from 2010 to 2020; articles on
sustainability management related to virus pandemic. The
exclusion criteria were: psychology research, articles, and journals
published before 2010; research articles having no link with the
current pandemic’s impact on the psychology of sustainability,
quality of life, and the global economy and additionally, articles
that were in languages other than English. The process of
retrieving and screening the studies according to these criteria in
this systematic review is shown in Figure 1. After an initial search,
FIGURE 1 | Flow diagram illustrating the literature search and selection criteria
(according to PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis; Moher et al., 2009).
a total of 265 articles were identified in MEDLINE (PubMed), and
85 through other databases. After removing the duplicate records,
272 titles and abstracts were screened. Finally, only 61 studies
were found to be relevant and meet the inclusion criteria.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Psychology of Sustainability
According to Chandler (2020), the psychology of sustainability
and the criteria for relative development are associated with
socio-economic progress, leading to improved living standards.
The study by Srivastava et al. (2020) proposed that the
management of sustainability relates to ecology, equity, and
economy. Meanwhile, Cartwright et al. (2020) observed that
COVID-19 affects the quality of life as overall economic,
ecological, and equity conditions have changed. According to
Bastola et al. (2020), psychological and sustainability factors
contribute to well-being and allow psychological development.
Recycling, dismantling, and demolishing factors are affected by
sustainability. The psychology of sustainability also relates to
deconstruction, recoverability, and oxygenation (Iacus et al.,
2020). Using the micro-dimension of awareness creates an

opportunity to increase awareness that ultimately enables
involvement in self-centered development criteria.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on the
Psychology of Sustainability and Quality
of Life
Political, environmental, and economic aspects collectively
determine sustainable development psychologically (Bowen et al.,
2017). These aspects also determine how humans should spend
their current lives so that the same quality of life can be
transferred to and enjoyed by future generations. According to
Garfin et al. (2020), minimal changes in human life slowly alter
the future, but future generations will not perceive their lives as
the outcome of change; they will think that people before them
have led their lives in similar ways. World Wars and pandemics
have impacted our present lives. Moreover, the COVID-19
pandemic has dramatically impacted the political, environmental,
and economic aspects of human life on which psychological
development and sustainability are dependent. This ultimately
affects the quality of life by disturbing people’s living standards.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 has agitated social
problems and threatened the economies of the world (Nicola
et al., 2020). According to Arden and Chilcot (2020), growth and
development in different countries have stopped. The financial
stability of both developed and undeveloped countries has been
shattered as the pandemic has targeted many lives. Human beings
are highly dependent on socialization. Because social distancing
and lockdown are necessary precautions for avoiding COVID19, the resultant increased stress and depression directly lessens
the quality of life (Balasubramanian, 2020). Most people around
the globe are losing their jobs, i.e., their income. Profit margins
and revenue generated by various organizations have dropped.
To save the economy and their citizens’ psychological health
from the pandemic, many countries have developed strategies,
but years of struggle will be required to regain economic stability.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated crises
have traumatized people’s psychological well-being, especially
employees who have lost their jobs. The well-being of employees
working from home is compromised as the gap between their
professional and personal lives has reduced (Pratt and Frost,
2020). The situation has stressed employees and has led to an
uncomfortable and aggressive relationship with the organization,
which has directly, or indirectly ruined their psychological
sustainability on a macro level. According to Mahase (2020), the
world before and after this pandemic will never be the same as
people have isolated themselves, millions of lives have already
gone, and the global economy has slowed exponentially. COVID19 has imposed the harsh realities of unemployment, illness,
and bereavement on people, and long-lasting hardships and
struggles are required to mitigate the situation’s negative impact.
Coronavirus has substantially impacted people’s psychology and
has created an extensive psychological experiment on human
beings, which will eventually change the overall lifestyle of
current and future generations.
Knowing that the condition of the current pandemic has
diverse effects on psychological sustainability, disturbs the
quality of life, and restricts people to having to deal with
preventive measures. However, according to Di Fabio (2017), the
management of the psychology of sustainability helps to foster
well-being and enhance working conditions within society. There
are changes in behavior in which most people are suffering from
stress, anxiety, and fatigue (Wang et al., 2020). The full lockdown
restriction of staying in the home negatively impacts on human
living standards. Professional examination reveals that increasing
cases related to post-traumatic stress, nutritional deficiencies,
and psychological issues have been reported. Oher psychological
impacts of COVID-19 include a growing fear of leaving home.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on
Sustainable Development
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Economic
Conditions
The interdependency of overall prosperity and integrity of health
emphasizes human dependence on the state of the economy.
Econometric analysis of the world’s economic growth rate shows
that the current pandemic has led to widespread health crises
and economic damage. According to Haider et al. (2020), the
economic situation depends on the GDP rate helping to affect
economic recovery measures. Global economic crises due to
COVID-19 reveal economic decline. Moreover, the report by
Allcott et al. (2020) highlights the declining economy related
to fluctuations in GDP rates. In the current scenario, the GDP
rate has shrunk by approximately 4.2%, the first time for a
pandemic (Fetzer et al., 2020). Another report estimated that a
difference of 7% is projected in the coming period if the same
conditions continue (IMF Blog, 2020). Additionally, there will be
a considerable number of further crises if the IMF faces losses.
The overall rates of advanced economies like those of Europe
and America have declined the same as emerging economies
(Kang et al., 2019).
COVID-19 impacts global trade and investment. In
Fernandes’ view (2020), changing global trading volumes
can be observed, and all industries are eventually affected by
the pandemic. The World Trade Organization (WTO) supports
this view (WTO.org, 2020). Its graphs represent the changes in
the average value of trade, which includes a contribution by the
IMF to change the economic outlook, which, in turn, relates to
growing global poverty and declining living standards (Bastola
et al., 2020). GDP growth projections make it apparent that living
standards are heading to extreme poverty at an increased rate.
Subsequently, this negatively affects the economy, as it leads to
economic crises.
Chandler (2020) reports that COVID-19 has impacted labor
by 68% in just 2 weeks, which signifies the loss of many jobs
and directly increases stress levels. The highest unemployment
rates are in Asia, Europe, and America. In Asia and the Pacific
regions, unemployment rates have headed toward a decrease of
4.5%. In America, Europe, and Central Asia, it is 10.5%. Apart
from this, fluctuations in trading sectors have led to a decline
in manufacturing, textile, cosmetics, and many more industries.
According to Iacus et al. (2020), COVID-19 has enormously
impacted the income ratios in developed and developing

countries. A shift in fiscal policy packages has been assessed
across 162 countries. It was distributed as Austria (∼17.80% of
GDP), France (∼15.30% of GDP), Qatar (∼13.00% of GDP),
United States (∼10.50% of GDP), and Australia (∼9.70% of
GDP). Monetary stimulus packages across these 162 countries
were distributed as Bahrain (26% of GDP), China (14.14% of
GDP), Germany (12.49% of GDP), and the United Kingdom
9.09% of GDP; Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020).
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Environmental
Issues
Along with the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions,
there is an environmental impact, which Cartwright et al. (2020)
discuss. The COVID-19 situation impacts global emissions,
especially in relation to the release of emissions into the
atmosphere. The lessening of CO2 emissions relates to the
effect of COVID-19 on human development, which in the view
of Bastola et al. (2020), led to the 2020 financial crisis. The
restrictions on human development and declining rates of change
evolved along with the loss of environmental degradation. It
was observed that in Asian and European countries, the extent
of the ambient particulate matter has declined significantly
(Gautam and Trivedi, 2020; Kasha, 2020). Urban and industrial
areas have less carbon monoxide and aerosol in the present
situation (Gautam and Trivedi, 2020; Holthaus, 2020). These
environmental gains mirror the losses in the fields of health,
education, income, and trade (Bai et al., 2020).
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Political Issues
The coronavirus’s impact can be observed politically when
lockdown and self-isolation result in reduced export and import
rates. In the current situation, it is difficult to carry out activities
designed to run the economic wheel (Haider et al., 2020).
Furthermore, there has been a considerable shift in the policies
and strategies related to economic policies. On the industrial
level, there has been a decline in line with industrial restriction.
Even though support is being provided for business opportunities
to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still restrictions
on mobilizing current development. According to Bastola et al.
(2020), political parties have provided funds and highlighted
financial support to ensure people’s survival during COVID-19.
Moreover, the impact of lockdown, isolation, and rescheduling,
as well as the spread and fear of the virus, have resulted in new
political perceptions.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on the
Global Economy
According to Moti and Ter Goon (2020), global economic
integration is required to deal with the implications of the
coronavirus pandemic. A balanced partnership between the
public-private sector, which takes into account the contextual
economy and health system, and is specific to each country’s
situation, will help national as well as international health
and economic recovery. The world’s total GDP depends on
the economies of separate countries; China’s economy is the
largest contributing economy, and the United States’s, the second
largest. Due to COVID-19, most factories are moving toward
closure and stopping the production of goods. This lack of
production of goods and services has a great impact on the
consumers, and no significant purchasing practices have been
recorded since the spread of COVID-19. In the same context,
declining sales are forcing the international market to face the
situation. Brands like Apple, Toyota, Jaguar, Land Rover, and
many more are facing the loss of investors and consumers
(Ahmad et al., 2020). According to Qiu et al. (2020), Hyundai
has shut down its business services and supply operations due
to a lack of consumer purchases. Starbucks has shut outlets as
consumers cannot purchase. A reduction in the import rate of
oil by China resulted in a decline in international oil prices.
Multiple uncertainties have been observed in the consumption
of smartphones as both demand and supplies are worsening.
The car production company, S&P, has faced declining purchases
(Ahmad et al., 2020). The aftermath of COVID-19 will thus
impact the global economy. According to an IMF report (IMF,
2020), the issues related to the current pandemic will restrict
the global economy. Overall sustainable development criteria are
expected to collapse. The distribution of economic policy globally
in response to COVID-19 was conducted across 166 countries.
It demonstrated that the United States is at the top, followed
by Sweden. There are few countries with no economic policy
such as Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Yemen, Liberia, and Denmark
(Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020).
Organizational Survival Envisioned by
Human Resources During the Pandemic
During the outbreak of the coronavirus, management styles
need to be changed to tackle operations and reduce the chances
of a crisis, according to Ågerfalk et al. (2020). This includes
consideration of online management, as online networks can
help organizations survive. In Donald’s view (2020), there are
two major types of organizational arrangements: traditional and
a new post-pandemic system. The traditional structure (prepandemic model) has existed during the past five or six decades.
However, its demerits were clearly evident during this pandemic.
It lacks clarity when defining roles and responsibilities. There
is a disparity in outcome attainment, and system workingconditions are less efficient. Although power allocation is part
of the matrix structure, in a crisis, it can lead to instability
and loss of control (Roome, 2011), resulting in an inadequate
organizational structure. The new-age model (post-pandemic)
focuses on the innovation, knowledge, and better required
skillsets (Guan and Huang, 2014). Organizations that are quickly
adaptive build creativity and possess a sharing attitude will be in a
better situation to manage its employees post-pandemic. The old
models based on power and control need to shift to a more open,
flexible, and modernized culture.
In the current situation, typical hierarchical organizations
will not result in better outcomes as the approach to allocate
power and authority to a specific group will restrict working
conditions. Human resources (HR) has envisioned a new model,
using distributed leadership, innovation, and continuous training
to adapt to the changing times (Hu, 2014) to obtain effective
results. According to McConnell’s (2020) study, organizations

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
with networked, hierarchical, distributed leadership styles,
cross-training practices, and flexible guidelines using survival
techniques to tackle COVID-19 conditions.
Support of World Trade Environmental
Infrastructure to Tackle COVID-19
The impact of COVID-19 is not limited to sustainable
development, as there are challenges associated with global trade
management. According to the United Nations Environment
Program (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP],
2020), trade is essential for saving livelihoods and increasing
economic cooperation. Whether it is related to COVID-19 or
typical situations, trade infrastructure boosts the confidence
level of operations and allows improvement of the transparency
of environmental trade infrastructure (Deshmukh and Haleem,
2020). Other than this, multiple actions and procedures
need to be followed for the management of the COVID-19
situation (Hishan et al., 2020). With support from world trade’s
environment infrastructure, there is an opportunity to supply
food and health products. This may help organizations to avoid
unnecessary export and import practices. Development in world
trade’s environmental infrastructure helps ensure public interest
and government support to effectively analyze the development
choices. Gilbert et al. (2020) confirm the importance of world
trade environmental infrastructure to boost the confidence level
and increase the transparency of economies. Deshmukh and
Haleem (2020) consider that the transparency of shared strong
data or collections of information contributes to supporting the
managed infrastructure required for COVID-19.
When West Africa suffered from a massive outbreak of the
Ebola virus, it led to a high death rate and affected the country at
numerous levels (Smith et al., 2019). Socio-economic disparity,
slow growth rates, shortage of food, and loss of businesses and
jobs resulted. We are facing a similar situation presently, which
demands that the health, economic, and environmental policies
should be modified so we can recover from this crisis and
collaborate in the future efficiently (Smith et al., 2019).
RESEARCH FINDINGS
The analysis helped to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on
the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global
economy. In the initial search, we found 350 articles, including 78
duplicate articles. After title and abstract screening, we were left
with 272 articles. Of these, 112 were assessed for eligibility, and
only 61 met the inclusion criteria. After extraction, the relevant
articles were categorized into the following subheadings to
provide a clear description: the author and year of the published
article; the assessment of the key findings due to COVID-19;
the present implications caused by the pandemic, and future
perspective that will help in the recovery from this crisis situation.
See Table 1. The focus of this work is to review the research work
published specifically in response to COVID-19. It is interesting
to observe that the majority of the studies were from 2019 to
2020. This is justified as the pandemic occurred in very recent
times. Hence the research mainly highlighted its current impact
globally and the lessons learned from current scenarios. Among
these, the majority are review articles, and only a few of them
were randomized and controlled clinical trials, which assessed the
economic, environmental, health, and sustainability impacts.
COVID-19 caused greater chaos than previous pandemics. It
is represented in all the studies: the global spread, its implications,
and how it has ruined all sectors, small and large. Even though the
assessment of various factors has been done in the studies, clear,
conclusive steps to be followed are not included in many of them.
The research has shown that developing countries are in a far
worse situation in managing their health systems and economy
than developed countries. Additionally, people of the rural areas,
the elderly, women, and children are undergoing major stresses
and life changes due to the pandemic. Even though air pollution
has decreased tremendously in all countries, post-pandemic there
will be piles of medical waste, which will impact the entire
environment. These research projects show that the management
and leadership systems based on power and control are not a
sustainable option in the future. Long use of a lack of creativity,
technological usage, and strict policies cannot be continued now.
Table 1 clearly shows that the pandemic has disrupted the
balance among all the nations. Though the impact is mainly
seen in the health sector and the economy, on a deeper level,
everything is affected. There is the struggle of SMEs, social
distancing norms, working from home, the new era of online
teaching, the suffering of daily-wage workers, a crisis situation
for the restaurants, hotels, and aviation department, changes in
fiscal and monetary policies, the psychological impact on health
professionals and health workers, and the extra workload on
the sanitation department. In terms of analyzing the research
findings of the included studies, it is very clear that the
impact of the pandemic has been assessed by one or more
of the factors (health, economy, environment, sustainability, or
management). However, it is clear that a conclusive result based
on the psychology of sustainability, overall well-being, and global
economic implications is lacking. Thus, this has contributed to
the goal of the present study: how can we learn from these
challenges faced by humans globally?
DISCUSSION
Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy
highlights that various elements affect economic conditions. The
study by Pirouz et al. (2020) observes that the current pandemic
hurts GDP as it directly weakens a region’s overall economy. This
is supported by the view that the loss of consumer consumption
affects the economy of regional economies, too (Fetzer et al.,
2020). In other words, multiple socio-economic factors lessen the
economic rate and decelerate the global economy.
The collected data also discusses the impact of COVID19 on psychological sustainability. The information gathered
revealed that humans experience an increasing rate of uncertainty
when stress, anxiety, and depression are continually increasing
(UNAIDS, 2020). According to Zandifar and Badrfam (2020),
there are various ways by which COVID-19 can affect sustainable
development psychologically. Evaluation of elements related to

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic TABLE 1 | Impact of COVID-19 and future perspective to improve health, economy, sustainability, and quality of life. Author/Year Assessment Implications Future perspective Moti and Ter Goon, 2020 Impact on the health and the economy As compared to the developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as African countries with a compromised health structure have been greatly affected. New policies should be implemented that focus on economic recovery as there has been inflation for essential goods and services. Government should strategically execute revised norms to combat the pandemic. It should implement a mitigation policy and a post-pandemic policy. The mitigation policy should target the nation’s health sector. It will include various new changes to deal with the pandemic such as defined containment measures, protection of health workers with additional benefits. Increased supply of the sanitizers and other Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). Regional opening of testing centers. Online education aimed at improving the awareness regarding the risks associated with COVID-19 and how to successfully manage them. The post-pandemic recovery policy will ensure that individual follow social distancing properly and also abide by the lockdown rules. For people to sustain they can be allowed to work for specific hours at offices, avoiding gatherings, etc. so that the businesses as well as the citizens are not at a loss. Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020 Assessed impact on the environment, health and economy. Air pollution has declined, however, the amount of medical waste has dramatically increased. Several fiscal measures, changes in the monetary policies and economy recovery have been shared by private sectors across numerous countries. Of 143 countries, United Kingdom ranks with the highest level of uncertainty in the assessment of pandemic uncertainty. Among 162 countries, United States has implemented the greatest policy cuts. Due to the crisis, many developing and developed countries will face recession as they have introduced several new policies such as fiscal, and monetary measures, and additional welfare costs with health policies. This has impacted developing and weaker nations badly. To deal with the economic slowdown, these countries will adapt to a scaled effect. Priority will be given to resource depletion over the sustainable utilization Governments across all the nations should aim to achieve an outcome ensuring that health, economy and sustainable development are not compromised once we recover from the pandemic. Berchin and de Andrade Guerra, 2020 Impact on sustainable development of all the sectors COVID-19 has led to an increased demand of healthier and organic food making the various food systems susceptible. The impact of the pandemic is largely observed among women, children, elderly, wage workers, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Several measures should be taken to achieve a balance among all sectors: Regional mobilization: Policies to ensure trade is continued and involves private firms to help small and medium enterprises. Global support to combat the risk associated with the cross-border transactions. Enhanced accessibility of technology: With the changing world and innovation occurring at a faster pace, technology should be provided in all the rural areas so people can access all kinds of information post-pandemic. Revised Policy: Policies to strengthen the overall system and not only focus solely on financial growth. Education: Encourage use of technologies and distance learning irrespective of the region or nationality. (Continued)

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic TABLE 1 | Continued Author/Year Assessment Implications Future perspective Donald, 2020 Impact on management and leaders; business and the decision models The design models of many organizations were based on the lack of creativity and flexibility, which were favorable 30 to 40 years ago. The importance of decision making, risk management, and involvement of stakeholders that worked previously needs modification in the present situation. New organizational structures are required, based on innovation, confidence, risk taking attitude, and flexibility. In the newly-designed organizations there should be no restricted roles, responsibilities, or structure. Training should be conducted so everyone is adaptive and can modify their needs as per requirements. Kottika et al., 2020 Impact on SMEs involving business and consumer markets There has been economic breakdown in the growth of United States GDP as it decreased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020. In European nations, GDP shrunk by 3.8% in the same period It is important to develop entrepreneurial personality traits as it is clearly shown that their attitude plays a significant role in the orientation of SMEs. A high quality of service should be provided to consumers following specific protocols that are open to change depending on the market situation. Etemad, 2020 Impact on the quality of life, economy, as well as the organization of various institutions. There has been a slowdown in the functioning of all sectors whether in a large or a small city, rural area or urban place. However, SMEs are the ones that have been impacted the most due to the pandemic. The situation prior to the crisis should be assessed closely, and processes followed regarding entrepreneurial and internationalization perspectives. A review and reevaluation of sectors should be done to maximize financial support to those who cannot recover on their own.
sustainability reveals that associations of social, environmental,
and economic factors lead to psychological sustainability
practices. The collected data reveals the impact of COVID-19
on the psychology of sustainability. The current situation has
a consistent impact on people’s mind-sets. As a result, there
is a need to adapt services to tackle mental health issues to
allow people to survive with an improved quality of life (Li
et al., 2020). With the declining economy, the contribution
of COVID-19 can be observed in the global emission system.
Labor can expect to decline in the future, and there is a high
chance of an individual facing job loss. This overall situation
leads to stress and restricts people in developing the economy
sustainably (Chandler, 2020). These employment issues are also
linked with psychological factors as they are the leading cause
of stress and depression, and ultimately hurt the quality of life
(Banerjee, 2020).
The collected data shows that HR departments are now
changing working criteria and focusing on alternative working
solutions for organizations. Allcott et al. (2020) observe that
COVID-19 forces HR to shift management from close-ended
to open-ended leadership styles. A dispersed workforce and its
interdependency on loose criteria are considered necessary for
organizational survival in the pandemic. Apart from this, HR
prefers to adopt flexible guidelines and cross-training practices
to provide practices and services to manage the pandemic’s
result. These sorts of instructions and guidelines help HR ensure
the survival of an organization and save corporations from the
calamities experienced by COVID-19 (Fernandes, 2020).
Similarly, most organizations are reacting in a managed
manner to increase their productive outcomes. It has been clear
that a declining projection rate is observed globally, and no
improvement for the projected rates is expected (Pratt and Frost,
2020). According to a report published by WHO (WTO.org,
2020), a loss of capital flows and a decline in annual charges is
decelerating economic conditions. Furthermore, there are also
considerable COVID-19 effects in the form of losses faced by
global trade and investment practices. Analysis of the impact of
COVID-19 on the economy reveals that the world’s economy is
expected to face further decreases in volumes and global trade
projections because the current situation is worsening day by day.
Along with this, there is an impact of COVID-19 politically,
which results in reduced exports and imports. Politically, a high
level of funds is required to support a country’s regulation
(Bowen et al., 2017). The spread of the virus endangers the
overall sustainability of development. The situation during
COVID-19 has been managed by the support of trade’s
environmental infrastructure as various macro-level elements
help to ensure sustainable development. With the help of
improved access to advanced technologies, it is anticipated
that production processes can make development more efficient
(Haider et al., 2020). There is a shortage in the supply of
drugs and medicine for mental health issues. This, according to
pharmacists, is a significant issue. It hinders the development
of health services and makes it difficult for practitioners to
improve their patients’ quality of life (UNAIDS, 2020). There
is an opportunity for support of world trade environmental
infrastructure as this allows corporations to work with advanced

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
infrastructures and increased interest levels. Moreover, world
trade support systems may enhance the efficient supply of
food and medicines. With this, there is a clear avoidance of
import and export practices without advanced infrastructures
(Herbert, 2020). With infrastructure support, there is a high
chance of transparency in the management of economies when
these companies support the developed infrastructure (Arden
and Chilcot, 2020). World trade environmental infrastructure
support includes a focus on planting trees and promoting
sustainable practices to provide useful opportunities to increase
healthy regional recovery.
The impact of COVID-19 on psychological sustainability can
be examined by observing the changes in people’s behavior.
Di Fabio (2017) shared the thoughts of people quitting the
workplace because of the pandemic, as this also affected
educational institutions. Along with this, a lack of healthcarerelated facilities contributed to the negative psychological impact
on sustainability. Balkhi et al. (2020) found that various
psychological factors affect people’s behavior, ultimately changing
global lifestyles. More than 80% of people worldwide show
more concern about safety as they prefer to reduce physical
contact with others (Wang et al., 2020). Around 23% of people
face extremely anxious conditions due to mental well-being
(UNAIDS, 2020). Other than this, the peoples’ behavioral changes
include increasing exhaustion and fatigue that directly restrict
them from working toward development.
There is a link between the psychology of sustainability,
sustainable development, and economic crises because all these
depend on the quality of life and related improvement (Rothan
and Byrareddy, 2020). Zenker and Kock (2020) mention that
the COVID-19 pandemic changes people’s lifestyles globally by
affecting their social, economic, and environmental contexts.
Multiple reasons drag the psychology of sustainability toward
losses in profit margins and revenue generated. Kang et al.
(2019) highlighted the crisis rate of COVID-19 by reflecting
on job crises, consumption rates by consumers, and increasing
unemployment rates. One COVID-19 impact on individual
well-being is that compromised work policies make it difficult
for employees to survive peacefully. In the same context,
multiple changes are observed in the situation experienced
globally as the condition of self-isolation makes people less
interested in harming the economy. Some of the destructive
realities associated with coronavirus disease include illness,
unemployment, bereavement, long-lasting hardship, and struggle
in handling the situation (Fetzer et al., 2020). Other than this,
there are diverse effects of COVID-19 economically, socially, and
environmentally. Rothan and Byrareddy (2020) used a survey to
explore the psychological impact of the ongoing pandemic and
found that people suffer from a lack of confidence and from
the infection itself. There is less concern about the maintenance
of health, as most people do not have access to infection
control measures. Along with this, there is no realization of the
situation’s gravity. People can only understand it in terms of
their situations.
Multiple uncertainties result from the outbreak of COVID-19,
as this affects the individual and humanity at large. COVID-19
has an impact on the psychology of sustainability, the nature
of thought, and the attitudes expressed. Within this context,
continual stresses are imposed on people from restrictions
that negatively affect their minds. Along with this, COVID19 stresses employees and others and creates an uncomfortable
relationship with a peaceful life, directly and indirectly affecting
psychological sustainability.
People’s psychologies have changed, as they are dependent on
the global situation, currently negatively affected by COVID-19.
The result is that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated crises
have traumatized people’s psychological well-being by disturbing
their social, economic, and environmental peace. The lack of
work policies leads to stress, as criteria for managing the situation
are, as yet, undeveloped. The data involving regional GDP
rates, economic efficiencies, sales rates, and trade rates reveal an
economic impact of COVID-19. All these aspects are directly and
indirectly associated with the pandemic. A fall of 7.2% in GDP
has been observed in economies.
However, we can learn from past crises to survive the present
global economic loss. In the Greek financial breakdown, 700,000
jobs were lost between 2008 and 2014 (KEPE, 2015). More
than 35% of medium-sized businesses were largely impacted as
compared to small businesses. Entrepreneurs managed to come
out of the crisis by providing us some key findings that can
help us to better deal with COVID-19. They ensured that their
products met all their consumers’ needs, lowered their prices
(Bourletidis and Triantafyllopoulos, 2014), utilized advanced
tools and technologies to provide something meaningful
(Giannacourou et al., 2015). Additionally, entrepreneurial or
managerial personality traits played a significant role in defining
company successes (Elenurm et al., 2014; Espíritu-Olmos and
Sastre-Castillo, 2015).
The various findings reveal that fluctuations regarding trading
system volumes when this relates to losses or improvements in
industries worldwide. They also reveal an increased proportion
of living standards worldwide is heading toward extreme poverty.
Crises are facing energy production as there are lower CO2
emissions, which mirrors the fact that human development
and progress are declining. Changes in management styles are
required to deal with how society operates and reduce the
chance of further crises. However, the adoption of a networked,
hierarchical, distributed leadership style, cross-training practices,
and flexible guidelines will benefit corporations in tackling
the COVID-19 crises. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 can
be tackled by the support of the world trade environmental
infrastructure, which is known to boost the confidence levels
of corporations in operations and improve the transparency
of global trade.
IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Humans have witnessed several previous crises in different
regions and countries, and humanity emerged from them. We
should think about creating a global change to prevent further
suffering caused by the COVID crisis. It is highly probable that a

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
recurrence of the present crisis will strike the global population
more severely. It is therefore desirable that:
1. Government be proactive and implement planned
precautions now before the situation worsens.
2. Management, institutions, and organizations develop
their skill sets demonstrate sustainability, resilience, and
innovation as COVID-19 has compromised traditional
business management and systems.
3. Globally, nations plan and sanction policies for the
collective good instead of their own self-interests.
4. All educational institutions provide necessary guidance
and professional help to deepen understanding of crisis
management. This will help individuals to become aware,
protect themselves, and avoid any risks or harm caused by
their negligence.
5. All the important health organizations, health
professionals, scientists, and researchers be provided
a targeted fund that provides sufficient training and
understanding regarding the pandemic’s impact on public
health, so the next crisis is dealt with more effectively.
6. Humanity take a collective approach to avoid unnecessary
harm to the environment. The earth can be saved if each
one of us becomes more responsible, provides support, and
care for one another.
We can learn a lot from this pandemic and become more
capable of dealing with any future crisis.
CONCLUSION
This pandemic has taught us that the entire world is connected.
If we do not work together and cooperate, humanity will suffer
drastically. We need to implement a few changes so that we not
only emerge from this crisis but are also able to continue with our
lives in a healthy and sustainable way. Firstly, it is important that
marketing processes are modified. Instead of blindly following
brands and getting attracted to the logos, etc., companies should
try to meet their customers’ requirements. There should be a
shift in business approaches from financial targets to what is best
for customers. Unnecessary use of plastic products should be
strictly prohibited. Secondly, any health-related issue should be
handled at a global level. If we limit ourselves to our own specific
race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, and background, humanity
will not be able to sustain this pandemic. A broader view and
understanding of public health need to be the key drivers for
all political parties. Thirdly, globally oriented with specific goals,
WHO should be the decision-maker for our health and wellbeing. Guaranteed budgets should be allocated, and policies
prioritizing health in different regions and cultures should be
planned. Fourthly, people from all cultures and interests, such
as health professionals, scientists, environmentalists, researchers,
politicians, sociologists, and ethicists should cooperate and work
to improve the current situation. Additionally, all the policies
related to the functioning of society, taxation, fiscal policy,
environmental issues, economy, and health should be changed so
humans can survive on planet Earth harmoniously.

NEW PAPER


Sport psychology services to high performance athletes
during COVID-19
These are trying times for us all. COVID-19 has altered our lives as citizens. The changes associated with the current pandemic have presented sport and exercise psychologists with many
challenges and opportunities related to sport performance, physical activity and health.
Here, we focus on what was, and is presently, being encountered by mental performance consultants in relation to the aspiring Olympic athletes they are supporting.
Within recent weeks, mental performance consultants working with Olympic aspirants have
evidenced a growing number of suggestions how aspiring athletes might proceed in their
sports and in their broader lives, based on their national conditions and regional responses
to the pandemic. Each national funding agency, Olympic committee, federal government,
and sport organisation, is rolling out strategies of how mental performance consultants can
work effectively with clients in what for many, but not all, is a socially distanced world.
Discussions have varied from the challenges that athletes are encountering to issues associated with social isolation, career disruption, qualification process uncertainty, and unconventional and limited access to effective training environments and training partners.
Underpinning these considerations is the health and wellbeing of athletes in their pursuits
toward excellence.
Historically, editorials within the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology were
paired with special issues, such as the one focused on international approaches to Olympic
athlete performance, published in 2016. Within the current editorial, however, there is a deviation in approach, caused by a global circumstance – sport is not being experienced as usual;
the challenges posed for those engaging in sport, region by region, are uncharted.
The focus we have set, in what should have been the 2020 Olympic year, is placed on the
shared challenges and the emergence of solutions that mental performance consultants are
presently undertaking in their work with athletes. The co-authors of this editorial are from
Asia, Europe, and North America. We have published on the topic of Olympic performance
and we are currently immersed in work with Olympic athletes in our respective countries.
What follows is a synthesised commentary.
The reader might posit that embedded in each author’s work, approaches are idiosyncratic
and driven partly by culture and context, which is a correct assumption. For example, some of
us are working from a distance, where others are consulting face-to-face. However, what we
share in common is astounding, despite our respective locations and circumstances. We
present this editorial, structured into three temporal stages: (a) before the 2020 Olympics
were postponed, (b) once the Olympics were postponed, and (c) the path being re-set
toward Tokyo, 2021.
Before Olympic postponement
Life tends to be normal before crisis transitions are experienced, within and outside of highperformance sport. Within high-performance sport, there were initial murmurings of a potential

https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2020.1754616virus in several countries, as the contributing authors helped prepare and accompany aspirants
to qualification events. Progressively, there were increasing numbers of people identified with
COVID-19; these heightening numbers were found across continents to the point where athletes experienced cancellations of Olympic qualification events. Initial postponements,
became indefinite postponements.
Athletes were puzzled, and near the centre of these discussions, their mental performance
consultants were seeking to support agile mindsets in their clients. Calendars were changing
and for some countries, centralised programmes began to experience positive cases of athletes
with COVID-19. Within some countries, programmes were temporarily closed. Within other
cases, the athletes were experiencing a much tighter world, comprised of their centralised
lives, though diminishing direct contact with the world outside their national sport centres.
What the athletes from these particular nations shared was a reality of being stifled and
apart from their local communities, including their cities, with limited physical access to
family members and friends. What became apparent for such athletes through social media
was that while they were distancing, competitors from some foreign countries were still able
to train in more normal formats, serving to advantage some and disadvantage others.
National sport organisations and Olympic committees then began to express concerns
regarding the scheduling of the Olympics. Within a fluid global environment, practitioners
were in contact with athletes, many of whom made plans, not only for the Olympics, but
also for after the Olympics. Some planned a continuation into the next Olympic cycle, especially
those in the earlier stages of their national team careers, where others planned to begin
families, return to universities or colleges, or enter into a professional career. Life plans were
in flux, and these extended beyond sport to a broader holistic existence. The stress responses
in the moment included decreased sleep, decreased appetite, increased rumination, loneliness,
and fear that present uncertainty could parlay into the loss of their Olympic moment,
altogether.
Underpinning our collective approaches were strategies that fostered openness in terms of
the concerns the athletes were thinking and feeling. Some of this work varied from in-person to
socially distanced consulting, though our approaches often converged. Openness was in part a
matter of encouraging athletes to express their challenges, fears, frustrations, and uncertainties, first to vent these, and then, to begin to prepare for problem solving as more information
emerged. Openness also meant encouraging a clear flow of communication among the athletes and those who worked with them in their sport organisations. Our belief was that
moments of challenge served to fortify relationships and unify each team’s membership. Openness was especially cathartic when discussions were constructive. This openness was encouraged beyond work with the mental performance consultants, onward to support seeking from
close friends and family members. Openness meant much more than sport focused discussions, onward to those about the basic human conditions, such as healthy living, eating, sleeping, and thinking in one’s general life.
Formal Olympic postponement
Within only a few weeks, Olympic committees were withdrawing from the Games. The domino
effect of these decisions on the part of nations then transitioned to the International Olympic
Committee and the host nation’s decision to cancel the existing date for the 2020 Olympics.
The athletes’ emotional responses varied from relief to questioning of whether a re-scheduled event would take place. Aspiring Olympic athletes are known for their fortitude and resilience. Their visions are set well in advance, whilst technical, tactical, physiological, and
psychological gaps are filled. The athletes then seek to be in their prime to compete on the
270 EDITORIALworld stage during their Olympic moment. However, suddenly, years of hard work, diligence,
and commitment were placed in question – one immediate unknown was whether there
would be a tangible Olympic Games or equivalent at the culmination of the Olympic quadrennia? Further questions followed. What about athletes who were already or nearly qualified for
2020 – would their qualifications remain valid into the future should a new date be calendared?
What should they do in the meantime, while the event was being re-scheduled? How could
they fill their days, typically consumed by training that was built around a time-based goal
of either qualification or Olympic engagement?
Not all responses were negative. Some athletes recognised gaps in their development
toward their Olympic birth or their potential Olympic performance. When athletes train at
high intensity, there is a particular time in a quadrennia, during the final year of the cycle
and associated qualification, where they and those who support them, commit to capitalising
on existing strengths and minimising existing limitations. Gaps always exist in every athlete’s
preparation, and many of the athletes began to reflect upon their current status and pondered
about their existing gaps. Several of us posed the question to these athletes “that if time were
allowed to slow down during the Olympic year, what would they focus on and seek to
enhance?”. These gaps were technical, tactical, analytical, psychological, or physiological.
Several of the athletes also had lingering injuries that compromised their ability to perform
at their best. Such has always been the nature of pushing one’s physical limits.
When the athletes began to compile a list of “gaps” in their current developmental status,
openings were created to explore opportunities not previously available to the athletes. These
opportunities necessitated creativity, as typical training access for some athletes was not
immediately available. For the athletes who remained centralised, more time became available
to delve into gaps and begin to explore these with their coaches, with support from mental
performance consultants. The shift for these athletes was from a feeling of being halted in
their progress, to a yet undefined period of time where constructive problem solving could
ensue. The athletes and those who worked with them could channel energy and strengthen
existing weaknesses, that could in turn, reinforce existing strengths when competition activities
resumed. Hence, if there were ever moments for interventions such as mindfulness, goalsetting, and re-framing, regardless whether these were from video and tele-consulting or inperson, that moment had arrived.
The scenarios focused on “gap searches” above exemplified effective responses to a trying
moment in time; one not all athletes would have capitalised on. Without constructive guidance
and support, athletes finding themselves unforeseeably inactive, or without direction, tend to
suffer from substantive psychological stress and potential mental ill health. What is known
about athletes during crisis transitions from both mental health and career transition scholarship, and in relation to the latter, particularly the injury and retirement scholarship, suggests
that lacking a career direction after years of immersing oneself in an intrinsic high-performance
goal, places athletes in peril. Some of these athletes have also been challenged by burnout syndrome. Personal feelings of alienation and poor coping responses, in this case, compounded by
social isolation, have resulted for some in compromised mental health. Never has there been a
more important moment for mental performance consultants to be accessible to their clients,
and to validate the multitude of mixed thoughts and emotions experienced by Olympic aspirants. Access needed to transcend availability; to the type of encouragement that could best
serve each high-performance athlete.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY 271Paths ahead to Tokyo 2021
As schedules begin to shift and readjust toward the recently scheduled Olympics, now in 2021,
there remains much uncertainty in terms of what Olympic pathways will look like by sport. Will
events become viable in the latter months of 2020, or will formal competitions and qualifications resume, early in 2021? Without a crystal ball, it has become nearly impossible to predict
intermediate steps of a now visible culmination to the current Olympic quadrennia.
There has never been a time when athletes and those who worked with them needed to be
more flexible and creative. The current pandemic offers opportunities that athletes and their
providers must find – they are right under our noses. Lessons gained through autonomy, ingenuity, resilience, life balance, mindfulness, and many more possible skillsets, can, and will, forge
modified, strengthened athletes and enhanced service provisions. Moments of quietness
present openings to reflect, re-evaluate, revise, and reform plans. These plans will undoubtedly
be roads less travelled, but highly valued. The pervasiveness of these life lessons can serve athletes extremely well, as lives are never linear; paths often are meandering, and even circuitous.
Retrospectively, we can all agree that even when one believes one is standing still due to uncertainties, one never is. The human condition is such that people learn from their circumstances,
and they do adapt. The days ahead will provide fascinating data, dialogues, and interventions,
built as a result of what could easily be dismissed as an isolated and unfortunate moment in
human, and also, Olympic history. However, one cannot underestimate the strength of the
human spirit. As for Olympians, they are, and will continue to be forged in (and through)
aversities.

ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning January 2020, has already had an unprecedented impact on 
children, families, and schools around the world and in the U.S. The context and impact has varied 
considerably over time, including tremendous variation in schools providing education services 
in-person, via remote/distance learning, and various hybrid configurations involving both 
in-person and remote/distance learning configurations. This special topic section of School 
Psychology Review aims to disseminate innovations and adaptations in research, training, and 
practice that help to inform and advance the field during the COVID-19 pandemic. This introductory 
article offers a brief acknowledgement of the pervasive impact on communities around the world, 
provides a succinct synthesis of several recent research developments focused on key issues 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and school psychology, as well as the pervasive impact on 
society, and then highlights the first three articles featured in this special topic section focused 
on adaptations and new directions for the field.
IMPACT STATEMENT
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on the education of children in communities 
around the world. Contemporary research highlights innovations and adaptations in research, 
training, and practice that help to inform and advance the field of school psychology during and 
following the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent scholarship provides important guidance related to 
important ethical, legal, safety, and technology considerations related to conducting psychoeducational 
assessments. Additionally, recommendations regarding consultation for parents to support young 
children facing challenges with inattention and hyperactivity are discussed.
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, described as a “oncein-a-century pandemic” (Gates, 2020), has disrupted 
essential aspects of public, economic, education, and private life around the globe (World Health Organization, 
2020a). Around the world (as of November, 2020) there 
were over 52 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 
1.2 million deaths associated with COVID-19 (World 
Health Organization, 2020b). In the U.S. (as of November, 
2020) there were over 10 million confirmed COVID-19 
cases and over 242,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a). The 
COVID-19 pandemic has already had an unprecedented 
impact on children, families, and schools around the 
world, including the U.S. (John Hopkins University, 2020; 
World Health Organization, 2020a). Presently, there are 
many unknowns regarding when the increasing number 
of cases will be reduced and the spread of COVID-19 will 
be controlled around the world (Scudellari, 2020).
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools in the 
U.S. have been closed for a period of time, while some 
schools continue to remain closed for in-person instruction (Education Week, 2020). A variety of strategies have 
emerged in an attempt to continue to educate and support 
children, including providing education services in-person, remote/distance learning, and various hybrid configurations involving both in-person and remote/distance 
strategies. As education professionals adapt to meet the 
education, social, and emotional needs of students, there 
are a range of services for students that continue to be 
disrupted (for example, food/nutrition, healthcare, extracurricular activities, family/community collaboration, and 
mental health services); thus, reducing the scope of student support services. Additional challenges for children 
during the COVID-19 pandemic include disruption in 
academic learning, social isolation, family financial concerns, greater childhood adverse experiences, trauma, 
grief, and increased screen time (Golberstein et al., 2020). 
Notably, the impact is even greater for students with disabilities (Brandenburg et al., 2020); students from minoritized communities including Black, Indigeneous, culturally

low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM); gender and sexual minoritized youth (Salerno et al., 2020); 
and students experiencing an intersection of oppressive 
systems (VanLancker & Parolin, 2020; Yip, 2020).
This special topic section of School Psychology Review
aims to disseminate innovations and adaptations in 
research, training, and practice that contribute to advancing the field of school psychology. Due to the continuing 
course of the COVID-19 pandemic, articles addressing 
this special topic will be published across several volumes 
to feature information throughout the course of the pandemic. Current research developments on key issues 
related to the pandemic and school psychology are discussed next (the pervasiveness of COVID-19’s impact on 
society requires a selective review). Finally, the three articles pertaining to COVID-19 and school psychology that 
are featured in this issue are briefly described.
RECOGNIZING THE DISPROPORTIONATE 
DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON MINORITIZED 
COMMUNITIES
While the COVID-19 virus indiscriminately affects all 
humans, it is known that individuals from racially and 
ethnically minoritized communities are at increased risk 
of contracting the virus and dying from it (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b; Yip, 2020). 
Compared to White persons, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are disproportionately higher among 
American Indian, Alaska Native, Black, and Latinx persons, while Asian persons have disparate numbers of cases 
and hospitalizations (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2020b). Excess death statistics collected from 
January 26th, 2020 to October 3rd, 2020 (compared with 
same week deaths in 2015-2019) show the tragic loss of 
life happening most markedly among Latinx persons, followed by American Indian, Alaska Native, Black and Asian 
persons (Rossen et al., 2020). Rossen and colleagues define 
excess deaths “as the number of persons who have died 
from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths 
for a given place and time” (p. 1522).
Factors identified that are increasing COVID-19 risk 
and loss of life are structural and systemic racism, discrimination, healthcare access and use, occupation, opportunity gaps (education, income, and wealth), and 
overcrowded housing (Webb, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 
2020). Students from minoritized communities including 
Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ+) are prone to 
additional bias, trauma, and discriminatory treatment 
during COVID-19 beyond that which they already bear 
due to unjust societal inequities which cut across all 
systems, including employment, insurance, income and 
access to health care, including mental health treatment 
(Gaylord-Harden et al., 2020; Lopez et al., 2020; Poteat 
et al., 2020; Salerno et al., 2020; Tsethlikai et al., 2020; 
Wakabayashi et al., 2020; Yip, 2020). Fueled by racist and 
xenophobic language in the United States including misplaced blame for spreading COVID-19, Asian Americans 
are being unjustly scapegoated and targets of COVIDrelated racist discrimination (Gruber et al., 2020). Further, 
the COVID-19 related school closures may be particularly 
harmful to persons who identify as LGBTQ+, and who 
have intersected minoritized identities as racial ethnic 
minorities, because schools are frequently places where 
mental health services are provided for those experiencing 
homelessness and having an undocumented immigration 
status (Zhang et al., 2020, as cited in Salerno et al., 2020).
INTERLOCKING SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION & 
SYNDEMIC THEORY
The tragic reality of health disparities is not surprising 
considering the history of systemic oppression and inequities that have plagued the U.S. and have targeted these 
communities since its beginnings. Due to the important 
scholarship of Black females including Crenshaw (1989, 
1991) and the Combahee River Collective (1986) on intersectionality theory, we understand that these factors are 
part of inequitable conditions stemming from interlocking 
systems of oppression (Velez & Spencer, 2018). Indeed, 
these complex cultural ecological systems have interacted 
with COVID-19 and pre-existing health conditions to create a syndemic in the US that clusters around particular 
minoritized populations in complex and unjust ways
(Mendenhall, 2016, 2020; Singer et al., 2017).
While COVID-19 is a global pandemic, the disparate 
patterns documented in the U.S. are not global, they are 
localized to our country due to our unique cultural and 
socio-political context (Mendenhall, 2020). Many other 
countries have not experienced syndemic outcomes during 
the pandemic (Mendenhall, 2016, 2020; Wilson, 2020). 
The reason Mendenhall (2020) explains is because:
pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, 
respiratory disorders, systemic racism, mistrust in science and leadership, and a fragmented health-care system have driven the spread and interacted with the virus. 
These synergistic failures have caused more death and 
devastation than many other contexts. (p. 1)
PSYCHOSOCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH TOLL OF 
THE PANDEMIC
Recent research has pointed to the impact of the pandemic on children and adolescents’ psychological School-Based Mental Health and School Climate 433
functioning. Much of this research has focused on the 
impact of the lockdowns, school closure, and quarantine 
on adjustment, largely in countries who were the hardest 
hit early on, such as China, Italy, Spain, and India. For 
example, Jiao et al. (2020) reported on the results of a 
preliminary study conducted in China by the ChinaEPAUNEPSA working group to understand emotional 
distress among children aged 3 years to 18 years. Rates 
of fear and anxiety were found for youth residing in areas 
that had high rates of infection, while distress was mitigated by media entertainment, reading, and physical 
exercise. Duan et al. (2020) surveyed 359 children and 
3,254 adolescents in China and found that 22% were suffering from depressive symptoms. Further, greater 
depression symptoms were associated with emotion-focused coping, being female, and residing in urban areas, 
whereas less depressive symptoms were associated with 
problem-focused coping.
In a study of the impact of being quarantined in India, 
Saurabh and Ranjan (2020) found that among quarantined children and adolescents, worry (69%), helplessness (66%), and fear (62%) were the most common 
feelings experienced by quarantined youth. In Spain, 
86% of parents indicated changes in their children’s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine; including difficulty concentrating (77%), boredom (52%), 
irritability (39%), loneliness (31%), and worries (30%) 
(Orgilés et al., 2020). A study of Italian children found 
that one out of four children showed regressive symptoms, demanding physical proximity to parents during 
the night and over 50% showed increased agitation, 
intolerance of rules, and excessive demands (Pisano, 
Galimi, & Cerniglia, 2020). Sharma et al. (2020) identified risk and protective factors for adolescent and 
emerging adult mental health in Nepal, a country whose 
lockdown happened with little warning or preparation. 
Risk factors for mental health challenges included lack 
of mental health services, social media use, lack of 
understanding of lockdown restrictions, and sudden 
work and student life changes. Protective factors 
included cultural acceptance of facemasks, school space 
repurposing, and free counseling. School closures may 
lead to disruption in school based mental health services 
for students, resulting in an increase in mental health 
difficulties among children and adolescents.
There is also increased concern that abuse and violence rates may increase among children and adolescents 
as a result of being quarantined. Humphreys et al. (2020) 
argue that parental stress and anxiety about financial, 
logistical, and existential concerns may result in parents 
managing this anxiety by directing verbal and physical 
abuse toward their children. School closures also mean 
that there are fewer mandatory reporters interacting 
with potentially abused children; thus, this pandemic 
has the potential to lead to reduced detection of 
maltreatment.
RESEARCH, TRAINING, AND PRACTICE IN 
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
School psychology has had to adapt across all aspects of 
research, training, and practice. As we remain in the throes 
of consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, assessment, 
intervention, consultation and other forms of service 
delivery have begun to be adapted, and will likely look 
markedly different in the foreseeable future. One of the 
most monumental COVID-19 related changes has been 
the sudden shift to telepsychology following the closure 
of schools, clinics, and community mental health agencies 
across the United States and world (Callahan, 2020). 
Telepsychology, while relatively new to school psychology, 
has been a focus of research and clinical practice for many 
years (Abbott et al., 2008, as cited in Drum & Littleton, 
2014; APA, 2013; Hilty et al., 2003; Maheu et al., 2020). 
McCord et al. (2020) offer empirical research showing 
equivalent telepsychology behavioral and mental health 
outcomes compared with face-to-face services. McCord 
et al. (2020) specifically highlight two separate meta-analyses (Backhaus et al., 2012; Hilty et al., 2013) which lend 
support to telepsychology benefits. Backhaus et al. (2012) 
reported positive results for the efficacy, feasibility, and 
client satisfaction of video psychotherapy, based on 65 
studies. There were four studies in the meta-analysis that 
included children/adolescents and three incorporating 
family therapy. Only 23/42 reported race/ethnicity data 
and only three studies evaluated video psychotherapy with 
a sample that was mostly racial/minority clients. The Hilty 
et al. (2013) meta-analysis included “telepsychiatry” and 
“mental health” as keywords along with others, resulting 
in 35 studies evaluating telemental health published 
between 1996 and 2013. There were seven studies specific 
to children and adolescents, while six focused on populations that are culturally and linguistically diverse. Hilty 
and colleagues concluded that their meta-analysis showed 
that telemental health outcomes were equivalent to faceto-face services provided with different client populations 
and concerns, including children and adolescents, across 
multiple settings (i.e., home and emergency settings). Hilty 
and colleagues stressed the importance of providing treatment in the client’s primary language. They also stressed 
more rigorous study designs and research and policy questions centered on race, ethnicity, culture and language, 
along with other key considerations (i.e., geography, psychological diagnosis).434 School Psychology Review, 2020, Volume 49, No. 4 DOI: 10.1080/2372966X.2020.1852852
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY CONTEXTUAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
The existing literature reveals the efficacy of telepsychology 
in service provision (Backhaus et al., 2012; Hilty et al., 2013; 
McCord et al., 2020).The professional psychology field, in 
general, is rapidly advancing in developing measurable 
telepsychology competencies deemed necessary for ethical 
and legal telepsychology practice. In 2013, APA developed 
guidelines for telepsychology (APA, 2013). More recently, 
a professional competency framework has been put forth 
to guide telebehavioral health across multiple behavioral 
health specialties in addition to professional psychology 
referred to as the CTiBS TBH Framework (Maheu et al., 
2020). Relatedly, the Consolidated Model for Telepsychology 
Practice compiled from multiple state (Ohio Psychological 
Association), national (APA) and international (Australian 
Psychological Society, New Zealand Psychologists Board, 
Ontario Psychological Association) guidelines has been 
recently created (McCord et al., 2020). With these advances 
come a call to consider how telepsychology can apply to 
school psychology practice. McCord et al. (2020) argue that 
more understanding of telepsychology is needed with different developmental ages and in school settings. Given 
that most school psychologists work in schools, how telepsychology works with children and adolescents in schools 
is particularly germane. For example, school psychologists 
must contend with ethical, legal and practice issues that 
may be similar to those in related applied psychology fields 
and perhaps different, given that many school psychologists 
work in schools where there are provisions such as FERPA 
and federal laws driven by the United States DOE. Further, 
school psychologists spend substantive time doing assessment and using data to make special education eligibility 
determination that might be more difficult to transition to 
in a virtual environment compared to teletherapy (Wright 
et al., 2020). Testing and assessment conditions in an online 
environment may not be equivalent to standardization procedures, calling into question the utility of some findings 
(Farmer et al., in press; Wright et al., 2020), and highlighting the need for further research to inform the interpretation and use of these measures.
One of the most salient issues is that of maintaining 
client privacy when delivering remote services, such as 
concerns about who is in the room during sessions, security of electronic communications and handling patient 
records consistent with HIPAA regulations (McCord et al., 
2020). Due to COVID-19 being declared a national health 
emergency, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the 
Department of Health and Human Services (OCR, 2020) 
has relaxed HIPAA compliance guidelines for health care 
providers, including psychologists. Still issues of privacy 
and confidentiality remain, such as when services are 
being delivered in the child or adolescents home setting, 
where family members, siblings and others may be present.
Legal and ethical issues related to telepsychology services, such as practicing across state lines, having a protocol when there are concerns about suicide risk and 
ensuring that a comprehensive intake assessment can be 
conducted when there is not access to traditional paper 
and pencil tools are issues that have been raised over the 
years and remain today (Hilty et al., 2018).
School psychologists are ethically required to serve all 
children and adolescents and to take a social justice lens in 
doing so (NASP, 2020). The abrupt change to online learning illuminated the vast inequities in access to technology 
(Correia, 2020). Therefore, school psychologists must carefully consider and advocate for students to have equitable 
access to telepsychology resources and have adequate technology tools, such as computers, laptops, bandwidth and 
other forms of technology to access instruction. 
Unfortunately, as discussed previously, structural racism 
and other forms of interlocking oppression precludes equitable access for students and families who hold minoritized 
identities (e.g., Salerno et al., 2020; Webb et al., 2020). 
School psychologists must help to promote equity with 
respect to access to adequate mental health/social emotional support and proper diagnosis and assessment, which 
is not occurring presently and is influenced by long-standing racism, bias and related inequities (e.g., Combahee 
River Collective, 2015; Crenshaw, 1989; Sullivan et al., 2020).
SPECIAL TOPIC CONTRIBUTIONS
Despite the abrupt changes described above, school psychology is well-equipped to address the changing nature 
of research, training, and practice. This special topic aims 
to disseminate such innovations and adaptations in 
research, training, and practice that will inform and 
advance the field. Due to the nature of the pandemic, this 
special topic section will be published across several volumes to disseminate projects in various stages over the 
course of the pandemic. In this issue, three articles address 
various facets of assessment and mental health outcomes.
Two articles address assessment issues during the pandemic. First, Stifel et al. (2020), Assessment during the 
COVID-19 Pandemic: Ethical, Legal, and Safety Considerations 
Moving Forward, delineate important ethical, legal, and 
safety considerations when conducting assessments during 
the pandemic. The authors first elucidate the complex issues 
for school psychologists to consider when conducting assessments based on the extant literature (Farmer et al., in press), 
which includes the international literature. Next, they provide a recommended protocol for conducting assessments 
during the pandemic ethically, legally, and safely.School-Based Mental Health and School Climate 435
Next is a research brief by Aspiranti et al. (2020), 
Comparing Paper and Tablet Modalities of Math Assessment 
for Multiplication and Addition, examined technologyversus paper-based curriculum based measurement 
(CBM) modalities for math across two single-case multielement studies. The findings from this study suggest 
that CBM modalities cannot be used interchangeably and 
begin to document the disparities between paper- and 
tablet-based assessment tools. Notably, paper-based format benefited students from low-income and economically marginalized contexts, thus raising interesting 
considerations for future research and practice.
The third article, by Wendel et al. (2020), The 
Association Between Child ADHD Symptoms and Changes 
in Parental Involvement in Kindergarten Children’s 
Learning During COVID-19, examined changes to parent 
involvement and child behavior (e.g., ADHD symptoms) 
among four- and five-year-old children and their parents 
before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected prior to COVID-19 in December 2019/January 
2020 and again several months into remote learning in 
May/June of 2020. Results indicated that parents’ ratings 
of their children’s ADHD symptoms increased from prior 
to COVID-19 and during COVID-19. There were few 
changes to parents’ educational involvement. However, 
parents’ beliefs about their responsibility to be involved 
in their children’s learning changed and varied for boys 
and girls. These results suggest that COVID-19 may have 
a deleterious effect on children’s inattention and hyperactivity. While there are limitations to the study, the 
results do suggest that school psychologists can support 
parents by providing specific strategies to increase structure and to incorporate healthy routines (e.g., physical 
activity) into the day.
Overall, these three articles highlight important 
information for school psychologists to consider as we 
continue to adapt and adjust to meet the needs of children, staff, and families within the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Psychoeducational assessment 
should be conducted after the careful consideration of 
ethical, legal, and safety issues (Stifel et al., 2020). 
Similarly, math CBMs conducted with technology 
should not be assumed to be equivalent to paper-methods (Aspiranti et al., 2020). Children’s inattention and 
hyperactivity appears to be negatively affected during 
the pandemic suggesting that additional parent consultation is likely warranted (Wendel et al., 2020). While 
further scholarship is needed to address many topics 
related to COVID-19 and supporting the education, 
learning, adjustment, and well-being of students; these 
articles contribute to school psychology’s emerging dialogue on the COVID-19 global pandemic and national 
syndemic

Abstract
This study aims to identify the current psychological research status from the perspective of 
COVID-19; for so doing, we extracted the data from the Scopus database. In order to outline 
the trends in terms of the number of publications, bibliographic coupling, and coauthorships, we used the constructed intellectual structure of the research with the help of 
VoS Viewer of Software. Besides, based on our understating of the content of published 
literature, we also presented some suggestions for practitioners and future researchers.

INTRODUCTION 
Covid-19, originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has become one of the most 
significant health and economic challenges for governments all around the world. The world health 
organizations have confirmed that the global epidemic in January 2020, and to deterrent the spread 
of Covid-19, most countries have already announced a complete lockdown (Jiloha, 2020). Besides, 
the government, research institutes, and funding agencies are spending a huge some to find a cure 
for Covid-19. In connection to this, world health organization, in February 2020, assessed the 
existing level of research and information on COVID-19. Resultantly, the WHO issued a call to 
global research communities to prioritize the funding on Covid-19 that can help to cure this 
pandemic. World health organization in a meeting (Organization, 2020) held in its headquarter in 
February 2020 identified the following area of the focus for research.
1) "Mobilize study on the rapid evaluation of treatment for use at the Community level

2) Evaluate the available data immediately to find out what level of treatment strategies are 
most effective from China and elsewhere
3) Evaluate the impact of adjunctive and supportive therapies as fast as possible
4) Optimize the use of protective equipment and other interventions to avoid and manage 
infections in the healthcare and community environments
5) Review the current information to classify animal host(s), to avoid continued spillover and 
better understand the transmissibility of the virus in various contexts over time, disease 
frequency and who is more vulnerable to infection
6) Review all evidence available to identify animal host(s), to prevent continued spillover and 
to better understand the virus transmissibility in different contexts over time, the severity of 
disease and who is more susceptible to infection
7) Accelerate the evaluation of investigational therapeutics and vaccines by using “Master 
Protocols
8) Maintain a high degree of communication and interaction among funders so that critical 
research is implemented
9) Broadly and rapidly share virus materials, clinical samples, and data for immediate public 
health purposes". 
Our study aims at supporting the 8th research agenda regarding sharing the current and 
emerging trends in research on Covid-19. Numerous studies have been published on COVID-19 
covering different aspects such as medications, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry, 
Genetics, and Molecular Biology, Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmaceutics. However, very 
less is research about the psychological aspect and the consequences of Covid-19. On the early basis 
COVID-19 data, we conclude that it connects to psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions such 
as fatigue, stress, feeling of loneliness, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, 
(Mazza et al., 2020), post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, 
delirium. (Rogers et al., 2020). Therefore, this study aims to review and analyze the bibliometric 
data on the research related to the psychological aspect to support the WHO initiative to curb and 
cure the aftermath of this pandemic. 
Bibliometric is the quantitative study of investigating the trends and trajectories in scientific 
communication, we believe, our analysis of the research on COVID-19 can help the researchers to 
appreciate the existing research and prepare the future research design and directions.
First, the work presents a trend of publication and citation relating December 2019-May 
2020. Secondly, analyze the worldwide perception of the countries with the maximum number of 
articles and citations. Third, the top productive universities and institutes are enlisted. Fourth, the 
leading journals are identified. Fifth, the most prolific authors are identified based on the numeral 
publications and citations in terms of COVID-19 research. The study did bibliometric coupling and 
co-citation analysis to see how these journals, countries, and authors related to each other. Lastly, 
based on the reviews of the data obtained, we also suggest some future research agenda for COVID19 research from the perspective of psychology.
The critical participation of this research is that it offers a general idea of the famous 
countries, journals, most occurring keywords, and future research agendas for COVID-19 research 
from the perspective of psychology. This study can assist the editorial team of the journals to 
recognize the probable area of growth for future research..
METHOD 
Scopus database was used to search the research publications on Covid-19. Scopus Database 
is one of the most extensive peer-reviewed research repositories in the Social Sciences. The IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
37
repository is also accessed and acknowledged for empirical and quantitative research (Donthu et al., 
2020). The following criteria of research consist of these entitle: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, 
“severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, “2019-nCoV,” and “2019 new coronavirus, and 
searched for it in the “Title, abstract, keywords” option the search results showed 674 publications 
since December 2019. 
The bibliometric technique is used to evaluate the collected statistics. Bibliometric is a 
research field of library and information science (Bar-Ilan, 2008) that studies the bibliometric stuff 
with a quantitative method (Broadus, 1987). This technique is instrumental in classifying and 
analyzing the general trend of a specific issue, such as journal, research area, or a country (Bonilla 
et al., 2015; Martínez-López et al., 2018). In literature, bibliometric studies have been used to 
determine the significance of a subject (Laengle et al., 2017) the role of journals (Amiguet et al., 
2017) educational institutes (Martínez-López et al., 2018) and country (Bonilla et al., 2015). 
This work uses the VOS Viewer to map the bibliographical material graphically (Van Eck 
and Waltman, 2010). The VOS viewer takes the bibliographic data as input and converts it as output 
into the form graphs. The research uses other bibliometric methods, including the BC and co-citing 
of the author's keywords. BC (Kessler, 1963) happens when two documents discuss the same third 
document (i.e., Studies A and B, usually known as Studies C). Co-citation takes place when the 
same three texts cite two publications (studies A and B of the C study). 
Moreover, the concurrence of keywords analyses the keywords that appear more frequently 
in the same papers. The following prominent bibliographic studies (e.g., Donthu et al., 2020), this 
study uses BC for authors and institutions and co-citation for documents and journals. The cooccurrence of keywords is used to classify the keywords under general topics.
RESULTS 
The search in the Scopus database showed that there are a total of 674 documents related to 
COVID-19 and psychology. A brief content analysis of these articles revealed that most of the 
publications were focused on the impact of COVID-19 on psychological issues. However, very rare 
studies have discussed the suggestions or interventions to cope with this pandemic. Thus, in this 
study, we endeavor to address this issue while providing a holistic view of the psychological research 
till 26th July 2020.
Leading Countries in COVID-19 
Since the COVID-19 affected almost all of the countries in the world, thus, to cope up with 
this pandemic, several countries from around the globe contributed to spread awareness through 
publication of their research work. In the following table we categorized the countries with the 
greatest number of. These results might help the future researchers to see what the most productive 
and impactful countries in terms of psychological research in the perspective of COVID-19 are. 
Following table presents the results of the countries that have contributed more than 10 publications

It is of great interest to understand what the networking connection among the 
countries is publishing research on COVID-19. For so doing, we utilized VoS Viewer of 
Software and constructed the networking structure in terms of bibliometric coupling. 
Bibliographic coupling occurs when two documents cite a third study commonly. Regarding 
countries, bibliometric coupling occurs when a document from two different countries cite 
the third document in their publications. This shows how other countries use similar
literature in their publications.

Figure 1 represents bibliographic coupling among the countries based on five 
clusters represented with different colors (Green, red, blue, yellow, and purple). The US has 
strong bibliographic coupling. The bigger circle in size shows the stronger bibliographic 
coupling. The countries in green color clusters tend to have strong bibliographic coupling, 
and the same is the case with other color clusters.
While having bibliographic coupling on the country level, this question might loom 
around how are the authors from different countries networked in terms of co-authorship?

Top Journals 
One of the other important aspects of bibliographic coupling is to find out the 
journals that publish most frequently on Psychology research from the perspective of 
COVID-19. Following table 3 represented the journal that has published 10 or more than 10 
papers on COVID-19 in the first seven months, i.e., 26h

Theory Research Practice and Policy remains the most productive journal in terms of a 
number of 139 publications on COVID-19 and in the aspects of Psychology while the Irish 
Journal of Psychological Medicine remains the 2nd most productive with 32 publications. 
We can suggest from these facts that future researchers should consult these journals for 
their seminal work.

DISCUSSION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS 
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 has consequences for the patient, families, and 
society. The scientist and biologist are continuing their efforts to find the cure to this 
pandemic; the social and psychological aspects should also be not ignored. However, since 
most of the resources are devoted and occupied for biomedical research, hence; the current 
state of psychology research is not up to the mark. Our bibliometric analysis on the 
psychological research in the first seven months of this pandemic substantiated this claim. 
This bibliometric analysis showed that there are very few studies on the psychological 
consequences of COVID-19. In keeping this view, researchers should come forward to help 
formulate the interventions. Practical and theoretical research should be initiated to cope 
with the crisis and to strengthen the mental and psychological health. Psychological cries 
should be taken as public health emergencies. The cooperation between community health 
services and mental-health-care institutions should be decoupled. Some studies from the 
past on SARS have confirmed that individuals who have experienced public health 
emergencies still have varying degrees of stress disorders, even after the event is over, or 
they have been cured and discharged from hospital, indicating these individuals should not 
be ignored (Cheng et al., 2004). There is a dire need for systematic studies on the IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
43
interventions to cope up the psychological problems. Hence, here we present some 
suggestions for the practitioners and researchers to consider formulating psychological 
intervention or conducting psychological research.
The immediate support system should be established in the early weeks of the novel 
coronavirus. Awareness programs should be conducted through devices such as television, 
radio, mobile phone and internet resources. There should be audio, video highlighted 
message that attracts the attention of the community. Programs based on psycho-education 
of covid-19, disease course, precautionary measures, symptoms, and management. All 
programs telecast with the healthcare and mental health professionals' team, expert's 
interviews, or messages regarding disease course, the severity of clinical symptoms, place 
of treatment and other factors to classify individuals who need management. Interventions 
should be addressed to most venerable groups of communities such as children, elderly and 
immigrant workers. 
Universities and institutes should have some online courses and platforms to provide 
counseling services to the patients and their family members. The people with a suspected 
infection disease who are underneath isolation or at home, community psychological health 
services should give primary mental health concerned. Although, in any case, since of 
complicated work strategies, the heavy burden of workloads, and insufficient training in 
psychiatry or clinical psychology, community health services do not always know how to 
diminish the psychological distress of patients. A specialized team is comprising mental 
health services in dealing with emotional distress and other psychological disorders caused 
by epidemics and further public health emergencies. 
Our experience is that some of the COVID-19 survivors will be prone to bear 
negative behavioral and emotional responses such as grievance, bitterness, anger and fear 
that needed to be dealt in a sensitive way. For instance, tailor-made psychological screening, 
such as a personal inquiry and invitation for the need for psychological consultation rather 
than arbitrarily distributing the postal questionnaires, would be much appropriate and 
receptive for counseling. In addition, when facing a possible future outbreak, psychological 
preparation such as stress inoculation (Meichenbaum, 1993) may be needed to strengthen 
the sense of social support, reduce the associated social discrimination, facilitate the use of 
socially endorsed communication channels without reducing the amount of contact, 
brainstorm and share the possible coping, educate and adopt some realistic threat appraisal 
and booster the morale among the staff. 
Second, in the psychological assessment for the COVID-19 survivors, clinicians 
should include social support, negative appraisal (perceived impacts), positive appraisal 
(post-traumatic growth) and self-efficacy, which may be essential parameters for 
monitoring the ongoing psychological and perceived physical health of COVID-19 
survivors. 
Third, these significant psychosocial correlates may embed essential values in the 
clinical intervention for the COVID-19 survivors. For instance, given the significant role of 
negative appraisal in the outcomes, cognitive techniques such as comparing with the 
disadvantages and reappraising the disastrous fears might be appropriate when particular IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
44
maladaptive thinking or beliefs are elicited. Further, the clinicians should not only actively 
inquire about the impacts of COVID-19 but also elicit and educate various coping efforts 
that may booster the coping confidence and reinforce their perceived ability to cope with 
the impacts. Also, allowing the survivors to review or reiterate the personal gain and growth 
from the traumatic experience may create positive meaning, reframe the impacts and 
possibly alleviate their distress

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has imperatively shaken the behavior of the global
financial markets. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on the behavior of the
financial markets of Europe and the US. The results revealed that the returns of the
S&P 500 index have been greatly affected by a lockdown in the US owing to COVID-19.
However, the health crisis generated due to the novel coronavirus significantly decreased
the stock returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. The results also showed that the
economic crisis generated from the pandemic in Spain has had more impact on the
IBEX 35 as compared to the health crisis itself. On the other hand, in the long-run, Italy’s
stock markets are more affected by the health crisis as contrasted with the economic
crisis, while, in the short-run, both lockdown conditions and economic instability lower
the stock returns of FTSE MIB. The UK stock markets witnessed that in the short-run,
deficiency of health management systems imperatively damaged the stock returns of the
London Stock Exchange. The investigation revealed that deficiency of health systems
and lockdown conditions have imperatively damaged the structure of financial markets,
inferring that sustainable development of these nations is at risk due to COVID-19. The
study suggested that governments should allocate more of their budget to the health
sector to overcome a health crisis in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, countries affected by a pandemic or epidemic that have seen large loss of
life also see an impact within the economy and in their financial markets; a specific
example would be the spread of Ebola disease in 2013–2016, which caused a loss of 53
billion dollars in the US (Fernandes, 2020). However, the potential damages of the current
virus are still largely unknown. Significantly, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection disease
was first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 and spread rapidly to almost the
whole world within the next few months (Albulescu, 2020). Compared to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 is more contagious, which has been indicated by

a different fatality rate1
. COVID-19 has infected 1,865,413
individuals, and 110,008 deaths had been documented
throughout the globe until mid-April 2020 (Financial Times,
2020). In order to eradicate this pandemic, the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended maintaining social distance,
which generated the severe lockdown situation on the globe
(WHO, 2020). Accordingly, the economic circle in the whole
world has been disturbed. Notably, the sale of Online Travel
Agencies (OTAs), Airlines, and Hotels has unexpectedly declined
(World Economic Forum, 2020). Even oil prices have nosedived
due to the sudden outbreak of this pandemic (EIA, 2020). Due
to globalization, the current coronavirus outbreak will aggravate
the economic condition, which can pave the way toward financial
meltdown (Huang et al., 2020). This pandemic has caused a
severe psychological impact on the economy while agitating
service industries and financial markets.
Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has severely affected the
financial markets while declining the value of stock index up to
10% in 1 day (Daube, 2020). Surprisingly, news or specific events
can fluctuate stock values (Shehzad and Sohail, 2018). Figure 1
revealed the market value in the European, American, Chinese,
and Hong Kong markets from January 1, 2020–March 18, 2020.
The period is divided into three rounds for comparison purposes;
the first time-lagged is from January 1, 2020 to January 23, 2020,
the second time-lagged is from January 23 to March 6, and the
third time-lagged denoted the period of March 6, 2020 to March
18, 2020. The results showed that the market values of these
indices significantly declined in the third time-lagged as COVID19 approached its peak in western countries. Spain’s stock market
share value was decreased by 27.3% in the third time-lagged.
COVID-19 tremendously shrank Greece stock markets.
Moreover, Figure 2 illustrates the volatility index (VIX) from
January 2005–March 2020. It denotes that the world has faced
severe financial crises in 2007–2009. The stock markets collapsed,
and the economies went through enormous pressure. A similar
scenario has been built up during the global pandemic COVID19. The stock market variance is at its highest for the second time
after the Global Financial Crises (GFC).
In this regard, the novel coronavirus’s impact is also
detrimental, and pandemic behavior is unknown, so its effect
on the stock return can last longer. Relevant to this, the US
stock volatility has been agitated due to the enormous spread
of this pandemic resulting in severe economic crisis (Sharif
et al., 2020). In such circumstances, it is quite significant to
analyze coronavirus short-term and long-term impacts on the
advanced countries’ stock return. This investigation argued
that as the confirmed patients of novel coronavirus increase,
the lockdown conditions becomes stricter, which lead to a
significant economic crisis and shocked the economic stability
of one’s nations. Moreover, deaths that befell as a result of novel
coronavirus specified the deficiency of health facilities, which had
caused a substantial health crisis. Particularly, this examination
analyzed the effects of the economic and health crisis due to the
novel coronavirus on the behavior of financial markets of the

all around the globe.
United States (US), Germany, United Kingdom (UK), Italy, and
Spain for the period of February 10, 2020 to April 9, 2020.
This study elucidates the effects by executing a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed lagged (NARDL) model. This
investigation provides remarkable policies on how to handle
the impacts of COVID-19 on the financial market and
answers the momentous queries of the researchers, policymakers,
Government officials, and academicians, e.g., firstly, does
COVID-19 have a non-linear impact on financial markets’
behavior? Secondly, does the health crisis or economic instability
generated by COVID-19 have a more significant impact on the
S&P 500 index? Thirdly, does the Nasdaq Composite index or
S&P 500 index respond more critically to the COVID-19 crisis?
Fourthly, does the economic crisis generated by COVID-19 or
the health crisis have a more significant impact on stock returns?
Fifthly, how does this suspended circle of economy, due to
lockdown, begin again? According to the author’s best knowledge,
this is the first study that examines the asymmetrical impact
of COVID-19 on the psychology of stock markets of mostly
infected nations of the world. Firstly, this project ascertained
the stationary level of study variables and discovered that all the
variables are stationary at I(0) and I(1), and no one is stationary
at I(2). Hence, a Non-linear version of the Autoregressive
Distributed Lag (ARDL) model can be applied.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
Data
This study utilized the daily data of the number of confirmed
patients and deaths due to COVID-19 and stock markets of
the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK, from the period of
February 10, 2020–April 9, 2020. This study has taken the data
from the database of Yahoo Finance and the European Center
for Disease Control and Prevention. Further, this investigation
analyzed the daily returns of IBEX 35, FTSE MIB, DAX 30, and
London Stock Exchange (LSE) for the nomination of Spain, Italy,
Germany, and the UK. However, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite
Index represents the US.
Methodology
This investigation utilized each stock market’s daily returns as
the dependent variable and confirmed cases and deaths as the
independent variable. The daily returns used in this study are
computed as follows (Syllignakis and Kouretas, 2011; Shehzad
and Sohail, 2018),
Rti = (ln(CSti/CSt−1i))∗
100 (1)
here Rti, CSt
, and CSt−1 denote the return value at time t, closing
price at time t, and previous day closing price at time t, for a
stock market i, respectively. The linear association between these
variables can be defined as;
1SPRt = β0 + β1USCt + β2USDt + εt (2)
1NSRt = β0 + β1USCt + β2USDt + εt (3)

where 1 signifies the first difference and β0β1β2 are the
independent parameters. However, NSR, SPR, IBER, FTMR,
DAXR, and LSER defines the return values of the Nasdaq
Composite index, S&P 500, IBEX 35, FTSE MIB, DAX 30,
and London Stock Exchange, respectively. Moreover, USC, SPC,
ITLC, GERC, and UKC indicate the confirmed cases of COVID19 in the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK, respectively.
Further, USD, SPD, ITLD, GERD, and UKD refer to confirmed
deaths due to COVID-19 in the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and
the UK, respectively.
To ascertain the short- and long-run asymmetries, this
study employed the Non-Linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag
(NARDL) model introduced by Shin et al. (2014). This model
performs best with a small number of observations and can be
applied on a mixed level of stationary data, i.e., I (0) and I(1). It
evaluates the non-linearity and cointegration between variables
in one equation; and shared the short-run variations to long-run
asymmetries after taking the long-run parameters into account
(Shin et al., 2014). The NARDL model is the extended form of
the ARDL (Pesaran et al., 2001) model; hence, the full form of
NARDL model for each stock market can be specified as,

cointegration among variables is examined through the bound
test approach of Pesaran et al. (2001). This method relies on Ftest to evaluate the null hypothesis, H0: γ1 = γ2a = +γ3a = 0.
For this purpose, Pesaran et al. (2001) has defined two bounds,
i.e., upper and lower bound. If the estimated F-statistics are the
higher than upper bound limit then the null hypothesis of no
cointegration is rejected. However, if the projected value of Ftest is lower than lower bound limit then null hypothesis cannot
be rejected; besides, if the value of F-test remains between both
limits then the results are not conclusive. At the end, this project
employed the Wald test to verify the asymmetric long-run, γ

STUDY FINDINGS
The descriptive summary showed, in Table 1, during the COVID19 era, the mean of stock returns is negative. Further, skewness
values of these markets are also negative except LSER with
high kurtosis, which predicts high chances of loss these days.
Table 2 presents the results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and Phillip Perron (PP) test
(Phillips and Perron, 1988). It showed that the study variables
have diverse stationary levels, i.e., I (0) and I (1), and no variable
is cointegrated at I (2).
Bound Test Cointegration Fallouts
The outcomes of the Bound test displayed in Table 3 disclosed
significant statistical evidence of a long-term association between
study variables for each equation. The F-statistics for joint
significance of lagged level parameters are stated as 63.02, 39.11,
5.4, 5.1, 38.2, and 14.03 for Eqs 1–6, respectively. These values
surpass the upper bound limits of Shin et al. (2014), implying
that long-run cointegration exists among economic crisis, health
crisis, and financial markets of each equation.
Long- and Short-Run Asymmetric
Cointegration Reckoning
Table 4 exhibited the upshots of the Wald-test. The statistics
particularized that USC and USD have a non-linear association
with SPR. However, USC revealed short-run asymmetric
affiliation with NSR. Besides, SPD caused an asymmetric
influence on IBER for both long-term and short-term periods,
while SPC possessed short-run asymmetry only. Additionally, the

results of FTMR designated that ITLD has a long-run asymmetric
relationship with it. The Wald-statistics of GERC enlightened
that it has both long and short-run non-linear impacts on DAXR,
but GERD has a short-term non-linear affiliation with DAXR.
Moreover, UKC denotes a long-run asymmetric liaison with
LSER. Hence, the existence of non-linearity in the study variables
led us to choose the NARDL model for computing long-and
short-run factors.
Modeling NARDL Parameters
The non-linear fallouts of SPR, presented in Table 5, illustrated
that expansion and contraction in USC brings a reduction and
increase in SPR, respectively. It indicates that strict lockdown
substantially decreases the market returns of the S&P 500 and
vice versa. Further, a positive shock in USD caused a significant
rise in SPR. In the short-run, lagged values specified that a
negative shock in USC amplified SPR. Besides, all the lagged
terms described that an uptick effect in USD improved the SPR.
Also, a negative shock in USD and its second lag augmented the
SPR, but the first and third lag represents the reverse impact.
Furthermore, the negative and significant value of ECTt−1 stated
that disequilibrium occurred in SPR today due to COVID-19
will adjust with the speed of 1.3 units on a subsequent day.
The R-squared value indicated that the 91% volatility in SPR is
owing to COVID-19.
The NSR model results exhibited in Table 6, particularized
that both positive and negative shocks in USC escalate the
NSR, while enlargement (reduction) in USD instigate decrease
(increase) in NSR. It specifies that an upsurge in the health crisis
in the US expressively distressed the Nasdaq Composite Index
and vice versa. Nonetheless, in the short-run, a negative shock
in USD and USC demonstrated an imperative decrease in NSR,
whereas an expansion in USC lessens the NSR. The negative
and significant ECTt−1 parameter stated that financial instability
generated due to COVID-19 would be settled with a speed of 1.5
units on the next day. The R-square value signified that 81% of
instability occurring in NSR is the result of COVID-19.
The finding parameters of the IBER model (Table 7) identified
that an assertive shock in SPD has an encouraging effect on IBER.
Besides, adverse shocks remain insignificant. On the other hand,
an escalation (decline) in SPC has a negative (positive) influence
on IBER, implying that strict lockdown considerably caused the
financial crisis in Spain for the long term period. In the short term
period, an intensification in SPC, SPD, and a decline in SPC, SPD
increased the IBER. The negative and significant value of ECTt−1
elucidated that today’s disequilibrium in IBER will adjust on the
next day with a speed of 0.82 units. The coefficient of R-square
stated that 72% of variations in IBER are owing to COVID-19.

that rise (reduction) in ITLD diminished (amplified) the FTMR,
inferring that heath crisis imperatively contributes to Italy’s
financial instability for the long term period. In addition, growth
in ITLC enlarged the FTMR imperatively. The sort-run condition
in Italy denoted that first, second, and third lag values of FTMR
harmed its own returns. Also, growth in ITLC has a negative
impression on FTMR. Nonetheless, a negative shock in the
second lag value of ITLC indicated an encouraging effect on
FTMR. The consequences of ITLD symbolized that proliferation
in ITLD possess negative sway on FTMER, but the first and
second lag value have definite sway on it. Furthermore, a decline
in ITLD has a direct influence on FTMR. The negative and
significant figure of ECTt−1 itemized that FTMR will readjust
the equilibrium with a speed of 0.95 units each day. The Rsquared parameter denoted that 85% uncertainty generated in
FTMR caused by COVID-19.

lag, second lag, and third lag values point out positive
linkage with DAXR. These effects are because of instability
generated due to COVID-19. The R-squared coefficient
diagnosed that the 94.5% instability in DAXR is because
of COVID-19.
Table 10 represents the results of the London Stock
exchange. The concluding coefficients of the UK explored that
augmentation in UKD improved the LSER, while diminution
in UKD reduces the LSER in the long term period, although
the growth of UKC brought a significant decrease in LSER.
The short term period outlined that positive shocks in UKC
reduced the LSER, but the first lag value of positive shock
in UKD showed an alternate impression. Additionally, an
upturn in UKD possesses a diminishing impact on LSER.
These outcomes designated that lockdown and health crises
generated due to COVID-19 negatively impact the financial
markets of the UK for the short term period. The value of
ECTt-1 showed that fluxes occurred today in LSER will get
equilibrium with the speed of 1.1 units on the next day.
The R-square value reported a 65% variation in LSER due
to COVID-19. Figure 3 depicts the adjustment of asymmetric
effect in the existing long-run equilibrium, once moved to a
new long-run equilibrium as a result of positive and adverse
shocks. The asymmetric plots denote the alliance of dynamic
multipliers owing to positive and adverse shocks in S&P 500,
DAX 30, FTSE MIB, Nasdaq Composite index, IBEX 35, and LSE
markets. The outcomes revealed that these markets tremendously
respond to the positive and negative shocks befallen due
to COVID-19.
Diagnostic Parameters Evaluation
The examination employed the Breusch and Pagan (2006) test
to diagnose the Serial Correlation and Heteroskedasticity in
each model’s residuals, Ramsey RESET technique, to ascertain
functional misspecification, CUSUM, and CUSUMSQ (Ploberger
and Kramer, 2006) test to define the reliability of parameters.
The conclusions of these tests given in Table 11, nominated
that there was no serial correlation and Heteroskedasticity in
the residuals of each model. Besides, the plots of CUSUM and
CUSUMSQ presented in Figure 4 remain within the 5% critical
boundaries, inferring that coefficients of the NARDL model
are stable.
CONCLUSION
COVID-19 has imperatively shaken the economic indicators,
primarily the financial markets of the globe. The number of
patients and deaths as a result of COVID-19 are increasing
day by day, and economic conditions have become entirely
uncertain. Moreover, the financial markets of the world fronted
a sudden crash in their market values. This investigation
utilized the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL)
approach to estimate the non-linear impact of economic crisis

that the returns of the S&P 500 index are greatly affected by
the economic crisis generated because of COVID-19 in the
US. However, an accession in the health crisis, because of
COVID-19, significantly decreased the Nasdaq Composite Index
returns. These results confirmed that economic instability and
the health management system have an imperative control over
the financial markets’ behavior. The verdicts elaborated that the
economic crisis produced as a result of lockdown circumstances
in Spain has more impact on IBEX 35 as compared to the

health crisis that resulted in Spain. In the long-run, Italy’s
stock markets are more affected by the health crisis than the
economic crisis, while, in the short-run, economic uncertainty
also lowered the stock returns of FTSE MIB. Nevertheless, the
health crisis in Germany pointing to a significant upsurge in
the economic crisis intimated an unimportant impression on the
FTSE 100 index. The stock markets of the UK recorded that,
in the short-run, an upsurge in the health crisis imperatively
damages the stock returns of the LSE index, but in the
long run, this influence was left to reverse. Therefore, this
research authenticated that the health crisis begun with COVID19 has devised another global financial crisis, and almost
every nation is fighting with these crises today. Moreover,
the study disclosed that economic uncertainty generated by
COVID-19 is highest in the German stock markets, while
the S&P 500 index is on the second-ranking, and Italian
stock markets are on the third-ranking. The study concluded
that the health crisis and economic crisis ominously affected
the stock markets of the globe. Consequently, a significant
amount should be allocated in the budget to explore and
prevent these pandemics in the future. Further, a complete
lockdown strategy does not prove to be an excellent remedy
as it harms the financial markets, so other strategies should be
developed, i.e., smart/partial lockdown. These suggestions are
essential for policymakers, Government officials, researchers, and
the general public.
