Psychology and politics of
COVID-19 misinfodemics:
Why and how do people
believe in misinfodemics?
Sonia Mukhtar
University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan
Abstract
Misinfodemics related to COVID-19 have negatively impacted people’s lives, with adverse
health and psycho-sociopolitical outcomes. As the scientific community seeks to communicate
evidence-based information regarding misplaced preventive strategies and misinformed helpseeking behaviors on global multifaceted systems, a secondary risk has emerged: the effects of
misinfodemics on the public. Published articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Elsevier
about COVID-related misinfodemics have been considered and reviewed in this article. This
review examines the mechanisms, operational structure, prevalence, predictive factors, effects,
responses and potential curtailing strategies of misinfodemics of COVID-19. The present article
shows that the popular variants of COVID-19 misinfodemics could be the joint product of a
psychological predisposition which is either to reject information from experts or perceive the
crisis situation as a product of misinfodemics mechanisms and partisan ideological motivations.
The psychological foundations and political disposition of misinfodemics have implications for the
development of strategies designed to curtail the negative consequences on public health.

the COVID-19 pandemic is even more challenging to curb. The ongoing coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has highlighted the interconnectedness of the modern
globalized world where public health threats can extend far beyond their point of origin
due to the unvarying reliance on and misplaced confidence in media platforms. During
lockdown, quarantine, self-isolation and social distancing, virtual communication has
become the major source of interaction (Holman et al., 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has not only escalated the challenges for
healthcare, social, educational, economic, political, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic systems all over the world but also gained momentum in innumerable
misinfodemics mechanisms: rumors, myths, superstitions, conspiracy theories,
claims, hoaxes, false misinformation, fake news, polarization, mistrust in science in
times of crisis, absence of fact checking, misinformation (misleading content, false
context, manipulated data, fabricated material, imposter documents) and disinformation regarding the etiology and outcomes, and misplaced prevention of the disease
(Mukhtar, 2020a; WHO, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has saturated the mainstream media which disseminate information on a local and global scale. Similarly, social media platforms have
also become an accessible source of (mis)information. Numerous incidents initiated by
these rumors have caused several mishaps across the world. For instance, a man took his
own life after a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 (India), and people have overdosed on
the drug cholorquine after the news about its effectiveness against COVID-19 proliferated (Nigeria) (Busari and Adebayo, 2020; Joe, 2020). There has been a failure to make
a distinction between empirically-based scientific truths and fabricated, unconfirmed
anti-science conspiracy theories among the general public. Such reports reduce the legitimacy of new scientific discoveries regarding a cure or vaccine for COVID-19. This can
also create social stigma, resulting in xenophobia, anti-Chinese sentiment, racism, marginalization, reduced compliance and adherence to quarantine and have adverse health
and psychosocial impacts (Aguilera, 2020; Rana et al., 2020a, 2020b). These considerations become even more exacerbated during lockdown, leading people on the fringe of
popular opinion to spend ever more time on social media. And as people are trying to
make sense of their changed lives, self-proclaimed celebrities, self-identified social
media stars, politicians and the mainstream media’s public figures are propagating their
own subjective interpretations of events in this situation of COVID-19 pandemic (misinfodemics) (Lederer, 2020).
Scientific studies from previous disease outbreaks have demonstrated that misinformation represents a secondary challenge to public health efforts in controlling an epidemic/pandemic (Earnshaw et al., 2019; Kalichman, 2009). Individuals who endorse
misinformation about a disease are less likely to follow public health instructions. During
the Ebola outbreak in 2014, respondents who gave credence to conspiracy theories
alleged that they would be less likely to seek support during the disease outbreak
(National Cancer Institute, 2020). In a 2019 study (Montanaro, 2020) conducted in the
US, over 90% of respondents reported trust in medical healthcare professionals, in contrast to a 2020 study, where the majority of respondents reported mistrust in information
about COVID-19 from the current administration and mainstream media news outlets
(New York Times, 2020).

The psychology of misinfodemics
Fear is an adaptive emotion which serves to mobilize energy towards the potential (actual
or perceived) threat (Mertens et al., 2018). However, when fear is excessive then this
may have detrimental effects on an individual (mental health problems like anxiety and
phobia) and community level (hoarding, panic shopping, xenophobia); when fear is
insufficient then this may also cause harm for both the individual (incompliance and nonadherence towards quarantine and isolation) and community (reckless implementation of
policies that ignores risks to the socioeconomic infrastructure). Likewise, interpersonal
safety measures can mitigate certain threats (transmission of disease) but can paradoxically enhance fear (fear of transmission, excessive health anxiety and psychosocial
issues). Similarly, social safety measures (lockdowns, curfews) help to control the transmission but prolonged and stringent measures could have negative consequences (socioeconomic impact, mental health impact).
Efforts to curb the misinfodemics process have increased because of its adverse
effects on public health communication and to encourage the adoption of sustainable
preventive measures, to manage social and physical distancing, psychological health and
resilience in socioeconomic conditions, and to address stigma, prejudice, discrimination
and inequalities (Mukhtar, 2020b). Among the various factors of psychological vulnerability (Mukhtar, 2020c; Mukhtar and Mahmood, 2018), a propensity to follow popular
opinion, excessive social media presence and a predisposition to anxiety and fear lead to
uncertainty, intolerance, and unpredictability. Coronavirus brings high levels of uncertainty and the inability to cope with uncertainty is exponentially higher causing anxiety,
fear and health-related worry. This situation is exacerbated by the exposure to a plethora
of information (including misinformation and disinformation) about the impending
threat, from mainstream media and social media alike (Rosser, 2019). Perceived threat
information elevates fear, and repeated engagement with trauma-related media content
for several hours daily culminates in acute stress and emotional distress and consequently
will either increase the fear of the virus, or cause insensitivity towards its course.
Identification and monitoring of the internet's ‘centrifugal clarification’ to filter the
accuracy of content has become more challenging as an increasing number of people rely
on social media platforms. One of the challenging problems of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media is the way they emulsify into false,
misleading and click-bait content. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a
‘mythbuster’ feature on its website as a countermeasure to the spread of unauthentic
news on social media. People who reported the highest media exposure reported higher
acute stress (Holman et al., 2020). Media exposure accumulates ever emerging threats
and repeated exposure to these events increase the symptoms of distress. Worry, fixation,
herd mentality and misplaced conviction make people more vulnerable to media exposure distress.
Alongside the amount of media exposure, the type and content of exposure matters as
well – exposure to tragic events, graphic images, conspiracy theories and violence could
instigate posttraumatic stress and fear of the future which will lead to poor personal
functioning. In recent years, the mainstream media (electronic, print and social media)
have established themselves beyond one government-run channel and the global 
114 International Sociology 36(1)
population has developed an affinity for the news channels in particular. While the older
population mainly relies on more traditional news channels, youth look to social media
such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Social media
have become a new conduit for spreading rumors, deliberate misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories and personally motivated anecdotes to appeal to followers
and attract attention and create panic (Liang et al., 2020). Some self-proclaimed celebrities and media stars have become so influential that a large number of people rely solely
on their content (Merchant, 2020). Some social media ‘posts’ are circulating on many
platforms and are endorsed by multiple social media account users to encourage optimal
personal functioning, maximum productivity, business-oriented activities, and downplaying the intensity of this traumatic event. Certain posts like ‘if you don’t come out of
this quarantine with a new skill, your side hustle started, more knowledge, then you
never lacked time, you lacked discipline’ circulating on various social media accounts,
prompting people to utilize their time in learning new things and skills, exacerbate the
worry for already anxiety-prone individuals and place psychological pressure to be productive. Rather, messages like ‘if you don’t come out of this quarantine with a new skill,
your side hustle started, more knowledge, then you are doing just fine’ should be disseminated on social media, for individuals to realize that during such an intense traumatic event not everyone is equally endowed with the strength, coping strategies and
problem solving skills to transform trauma into a positive emotion, which is okay and not
a source of shame and guilt.
There is a coercive impression percolating among individuals regarding the lockdown
that people should not assume it is a holiday, but that they must utilize their time productively and engage in occupational or academic activities. This psychological pressure has
further aggravated feelings of guilt, shame, regret, sadness, self-pity, anger, internalized
emotions, being overwhelmed, negative self-talk, unrealistic expectations and a perceived sense of failure (see Mukhtar, 2020a, 2020b). The psychological pressure to compete with peers in achieving a maximum of tasks, producing occupational and academic
outcomes, harnessing a herd of followers and subscribers on one’s media accounts, and
downplaying one’s own trauma and that of others will have devastating effects on mental
wellbeing.
Lockdown resulting in self-isolation, quarantine and social distancing is far removed
from normal leisure time that might be utilized for improved personal functioning – it is a
collective traumatic event which poses a serious threat to people and has resulted in a huge
loss of lives and displacement for many individuals (Mukhtar and Mukhtar, 2020; Mukhtar
and Rana, 2020). COVID-19 is an individual and collective traumatic event and directly or
indirectly has affected every individual in the world. All efforts should be directed towards
minimizing the negative effects of this traumatic COVID-19 pandemic on ‘survivors’.
Many people are going through interpersonal traumatic events in addition to the collective
trauma of COVID-19: domestic violence (gender-based violence), abuse (Mukhtar, 2020d),
financial burden, loneliness, emotional and behavioral problems, grief and bereavement,
fear of losing family, mental health issues, physical injuries or fatalities .
Isolated people facing psychological issues require trauma-focused psychological
support (mental health care, psychological support, guidance, treatment, intervention
and information) such as psychological cyber-counseling, via one’s smartphone for 
Mukhtar 115
instance, and mental health hotlines. Professional help-seeking behaviors should be
encouraged and endorsed and related barriers like stigma, marginalization, discrimination, shaming and phobias should be discouraged through government-driven programs
and evidence-based treatment models.
Emerging pandemics command the intellectual incapacity of decision-making (a
degree of irrationality) when bombarded with conflicting opinions and conspiracy theories and thus the empirical interpretation of origins and impacts result in moral judgments
based on religious and cultural beliefs. The emergence of HIV/AIDS garnered a plethora
of moral judgments orbiting around sexual morality and substance abuse; the arrival of
SARS saw blame directed towards primitive farming practices in Guangzhou; and the
unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has welcomed a magnitude of misinfodemics on a
multitude of fronts (Ophir, 2018; Richtel, 2020). A psychological predisposition to reject
authorized information through denial as a byproduct of deep founded mistrust, and the
tendency to view major social and political events through conspiracies and partisan motivations as a byproduct of conspiracy thinking are the likely explanatory factors in understanding ‘why’ and ‘who’ believes in COVID-19 misinfodemics. The association between
conspiracy thinking and defense-mechanism denial could be a potential reason for the
refusal of corrective actions in several health-related cases (Carey et al., 2020).
Misinfodemics could be motivated by various factors – an epistemic desire for causal
explanation and subjective certainty, or an existential desire for control and security, or the
social desire to maintain a positive image of the self or group (Douglas et al., 2017).
Stigmatization, labeling, scapegoating and fear swiftly follow with a narrative which
invokes the vernacular of human conflict – waging war against a killer virus, an indomitable invisible threat, an enemy armed with no-vaccine flinging victims in quarantine
camps – losing a sense of proportion and the ability to mitigate fear and use reasonable
knowledge-based measures to challenge and normalize the perceived threat of infection.
The mechanism of misinfodemics is engrossed in silos of public information which is
inept at limiting risks (Wald, 2008), for instance: the social theme focusing on socioeconomic disruption; the scientific theme focusing on medical and health risk communication; and the pandemic theme focusing on state and global response. Populations most
likely to be affected by an emerging disease pandemic and a simultaneous misinfodemics
include those where there is a disproportionally low or inadequate health literacy, disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, migrants, ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups
including older people, people with chronic health conditions and people with disability
(Mukhtar, 2020e; Rowlands et al., 2015).
The politics of coronavirus
Conspiracy theories heavily influenced by geopolitics have spread regarding the origin,
scale, prevention, treatment and self-diagnosis of the disease: of COVID-19 being a viral
bioweapon genetically engineered by a rogue government with a racist and genocidal
agenda to wage an economic and psychological war – the Chinese biological weapon
conspiracy theory (which has spread throughout the United States, United Kingdom,
India and Ukraine), or the US biological weapon conspiracy theory (spread throughout
Russia, Iran, China, the Philippines and Venezuela); a plot by Muslims, or a plot by Jews; 
116 International Sociology 36(1)
espionage; a population control scheme; and medical misinformation (vaccine’s preexistence, cocaine cure, African resistance, 5G, vegetarian immunity and methanol use)
and other views endorsed by presidents, governments and public figures abound, causing
misinfodemics of incorrect information about the virus, etc., which poses risks on a
global scale (McCarthy, 2020).
Meanwhile, COVID-19 could be positively viewed through the partisan lens of
right-wing nationalism and the pandemonium of allegations. Coronavirus is a gift for
the politics of misinfodemics, censorship and pathological nationalism. A multitude of
governments have ‘introduced’ a policy of blame-shifting by launching their powerrivalry statements revolving around illogical reasoning and a narrative of national
immunity towards COVID-19: in the US there are claims of a ‘biological weapon
against the Western world’, ‘Chinese experiment gone wrong’, ‘China as equivalent to
USSR-level threat’ and the most infamous ‘Chinese virus’; Italy has accused migrants
from Africa as the disease carriers to its shores; in France, Hungary and the UK there
is the narration of a correlation between immigrants and coronavirus (reminiscent of
the influx of migrants from war-inflicted countries in 2015 and the so-called border
crisis); European right-wingers declare the ‘enemy has not changed, it is migrants’.
And so the convergence of two crises aggravates mistrust in scientific, political and
economic bodies around the world. These narratives imply through a heavily nuanced
differential discourse that their countries are immune to coronavirus and they would
not have contracted COVID-19, or could manage it effectively, if only for the absence
of immigrants (McCarthy, 2020).
COVID-19 has provided rich fodder for Europe’s nativist populist tune to further
incite the clamor to bar immigrants and building walls/closing borders, to anti-immigration policies. Public opinions are shaped by the landscape of media, scientific bodies and
the frameworks of governments and thus such obstinate prejudice and confrontations
ignite de-globalization, nationalism, nativism, protectionism, tariffs, closed borders and
erection of walls which will intensify the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
In Pakistan, a research study conducted by IPSOS revealed that 82% of people in the
country believed that performing ablution will keep them protected from transmitting
coronavirus, and others believed that congregation prayers and shaking hands cannot
infect anyone since it is Sunnah (SAMAA, 2020). Claims circulating about Pakistanis’
resistance to coronavirus were quite prevalent as they were backed by Pakistan’s relatively low mortality rate. These rumors argued that Pakistan’s culture, religion, geographical location and climate made Pakistanis less vulnerable to the virus. In India,
political activists claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung to one’s body
can cure coronavirus; a parliamentarian claimed that saying Namaste instead of Arab
greetings prevents the contraction of coronavirus; an influential film celebrity claimed
that vibrations generated by clapping and blowing conch shells will kill the virus; a selfproclaimed TikTok media star’s claim about eating a poisonous fruit as a preventive
measure hospitalized 11 people; and an ‘anti-coronavirus drug’ and ‘anti-coronavirus
mattress’ have been quite prevalent. For example, a popular myth in various countries is
that home remedies can cure or prevent people from contracting coronavirus. One of
these rumored remedies that has gained traction on social media (with severe, adverse
effects) involves mixing sodium chlorite solution with citric acid, producing chlorine 
Mukhtar 117
dioxide – a powerful bleaching agent – claiming antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial
benefits. Similar phenomena were observed all over the world, which may have prolonged the health, psychosocial and economic consequences of COVID-19 among the
general public (Shu et al., 2017).
It becomes more difficult to limit the negative impact of misinfodemics especially when
partisanship can be mobilized in this effort. There could be three strategies to overcome
these negative effects: (a) prevention strategies – to limit the aim and spread of, or exposure to misinfodemics; (b) corrective strategies – founded in scientific and empirical
knowledge to challenge these predispositions, their effects and subsequent belief system
and reduce uncertainty, increase perceived control and promote self-image; (c) collaborative strategies – corrective strategies can be efficacious if other political and social agents
can be activated and mobilized to override partisan, ideological motivations and misinfodemics tendencies. When politics and the media promote misinformation, likeminded individuals exposed to this rhetoric are more likely to follow elite cues and motivated reasoning
and engage with these ideas. Cues from partisan elites have the potential to inflame and
foster misinfodemics as they shape the landscape of information for the general public
(Swire et al., 2017). For instance, at the outset of COVID-19, the American political administration referred to COVID-19 as a ‘new hoax’ (Rieder, 2020) and likened the pandemic to
common flu (Brooks, 2020) or coronavirus as a bioweapon (Stevenson, 2020). This rhetoric is likely to encourage the adoption of related beliefs and lead likeminded supporters to
take the threat less seriously. Media outlets including news personalities and media figures
cast aspersion on the threat of COVID-19 by questioning if hospitals were truly filled with
coronavirus infected patients (Peters, 2020). After the toll on human life became increasingly apparent and unassailable, change in the reporting and behavior on the part of media
and political leaders who had previously (explicitly and unequivocally) trafficked in misinfodemics now hinted at the possibility of misinformation having actually served to correct and prevent negative consequences among the general public.
Animosity, wrapped in hatred inside the hostility
Some media channels initially ran racially labeled and biased headlines on COVID-19, such
as ‘Chinese virus pandemonium’, ‘China kids stay home’, ‘China is the real sick man of
Asia’, ‘Chinese coronavirus’, or ‘kung-flu’, which caused xenophobia and misperceptions,
misled the general public and witnessed a surge in anti-Chinese sentiment and racist-driven
cases against individuals of Chinese origin outside China. Anti-Chinese and anti-Asian xenophobia has been reported in many countries including the US, the UK, Australia and many
European countries. Many Chinese customers were refused entrance into restaurants in
Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia (Amnesty International, 2020).
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
issued a statement on Twitter: ‘It’s understandable to be alarmed by #Coronavirus. But
no amount of fear can excuse prejudice & discrimination against people of Asian descent.
Let’s #FightRacism, call out hatred & support each other in this time of a public health
emergency. #StandUp4HumanRights.’
A similar response on Twitter began ‘#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus’ (‘I am not a virus’) after
a French newspaper’s front-page headline, ‘Yellow alert’. Ontario’s Human Rights 
118 International Sociology 36(1)
Commission (OHRC) stated that discrimination is prohibited under the Human Rights
Code (Aguilera, 2020; Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2020).
A government’s dilemma – to be or not to be
At the time of writing, the government of Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister
Mr Imran Khan has witnessed a sudden setback, as with the number of cases steadily
increasing their challenge is to curtail the path of the disease in Pakistan. However, there
is a bigger dilemma the government of Pakistan is facing – to be or not to be – partial
lockdown or no lockdown. Either way, this message has a common intention – to minimize the urgency and severity of the pandemic, downplay social isolation measures, disregard the potential crisis in the health sector (while exaggerating the impact on the
economy for the recession that looms on the horizon) and overlook the mitigating measures necessary to stem transmission and medical mistrust among the public (Alwan et al.,
2020; Prem et al., 2020). Religion, politics and business – fundamentally governing
aspects of Pakistan – are opposed to the lockdown and are putting pressure on the government, consequently resulting in the lifting of lockdown. In Pakistan, pandemic or no pandemic, hardline clerics hold the power to override the government’s social-distancing
instructions, put in place in April 2020. Dozens of well-known clerics signed a letter
warning that the government should exempt mosques from the shutdown during the
month of Ramadan or otherwise invite ‘God’s wrath’ (an ulterior narrative insinuating the
political chaos that clerics have unleashed in the past), exercising their religious authority
to gather loyalists to lay siege on the state. The subservient state has already signed an
agreement deferentially promising to abide by the deal, begging the question: who is in
charge of the government during this pandemic crisis – the government or mosques?
Physical and mental health, social and interpersonal factors including intimate partner
violence, marital rape, child abuse, domestic violence, racism, xenophobia, dissociation,
bias, prejudice, stigmatization and marginalization are the least of Pakistani clerics and
mosques’ concerns during this public crisis. Clerics have to protect their two central interests: money and power. Millions of dollars of charitable donations during Ramadan benefit Pakistan’s mosques, which are not under the state’s authority, and clerics who often
partake in political power can challenge the government. Despite all the evidence, a prevalent rhetoric undermining the COVID-19 related risks has been endorsed (and ‘austerely’
followed by the public) at the highest level of authority in Pakistan: the clerics.
Religious misinfodemics is a new branch of clerics’ superciliously propagated doctrine narrated through the lens of pandemic religious-explanation: God could not have
allowed such a disease to emerge and only through rigorous devotion in congregational
prayer can followers of the faith conquer the devil’s machinations in the form of coronavirus; and if anyone tries to halt these efforts then these Zionist agents are the pawns of
evil bent on destroying the faith. This dogmatic doctrine seeps through the ever present,
ever omniscient online media to infiltrate the minds of sheeple-votary-conformists – usually the heads of the household who enforce these maladaptive cognitive twisted patterns
within their families. These instructions dictated by the ‘higher authorities’, and their
adherence, are infringing on individual rights and freedom, planting unquestionable
canon, propagating anti-science and medical mistrust among the public, putting people 
Mukhtar 119
at risk, and halting the emergency control and preventive measures necessary to curb the
pandemic and thus creating public panic, social unrest and distrust in systems (Kalb,
2003; Strong, 1990). These eschewed beliefs can result in adverse behavioral consequences (for instance, failing to administer polio vaccination to one’s children, attributing it as un-Islamic, and contributing to the resurgence of this once eradicated disease in
Pakistan). Misinfodemics, especially those which revolve around science, medicine and
health-related topics, are widespread and prompting people to eschew appropriate healthrelated behaviors (Jolley and Douglas, 2014; Oliver and Wood, 2014).
Potential strategies of curtailment
As research has predicted, there are psychosocial stress and adverse health outcomes for
people in self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine, and this crisis situation will
require remediation from credible sources of information. These include, in the US for
example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), and especially WHO, which has partnered with several social media
platforms and technological companies (Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter,
Facebook and YouTube) to promote health updates and curb misinformation and disinformation (Hossain et al., 2020). They are seeking to safeguard and ensure effective communication on COVID-19 between healthcare systems and the general public. Despite all
these efforts, infodemics is rampant and multiple misinformation and disinformation
sources are circulating on social media accounts. To address these discrepancies, certain
strategies can be implemented: (a) empirically evidence-based scientific research findings
→ with integration in communication and information technology → to frontline healthcare providers → who communicate with patients and caregivers and populations at risk
→ results in positive health outcomes → and subsequent optimization of resources; (b)
building strategic partnerships (local and global levels) → coordinate connecting offline
and online resources for the communication of uniform information → across all platforms from mass media, community organizations and support groups → to community
and society; (c) contain infodemics of information and disinformation → and disseminate
scientifically evidence-based information → through ‘data-mining algorithms’ to detect
and remove fake news (Shu et al., 2017); (d) those who propagate misinformation
(accountable individuals and online portals) should be identified by local authorities and
law enforcement agencies → precautionary culturally tailored information, translated into
multiple language manuals of factual data regarding COVID-19 should be promoted
through mass media campaigns; and (e) an e-care evidence-based approach and e-services
in local languages (mostly graphic and pictorial for easy understanding) should be made
available → for people with limited access to healthcare, elderly people, rural areas, the
general public in self-isolation and quarantined → to decrease COVID-19 infection.
It is imperative to bring communities and institutional leadership together to promote
transparency and good information governance to control the misinfodemics related to
COVID-19 for both people’s physical, mental and psychosocial health and sound economic, political and systematic functioning during this pandemic (Oliver and Wood, 2014).
The world needs coordinated national and international efforts to apply the scientific
empirical data in local settings to mitigate the grave predicament of lockdown aftereffects 
120 International Sociology 36(1)
and associated issues. Mass media, healthcare organizations, community-based organizations and stakeholders should strategically join in partnership to disseminate, based on
mutual consensus, empirically-based public health messages and remove anti-science
online content through natural language processing and data-mining approaches. The best
global solution for a global disease is international collaboration – the exchange of scientific ideas, health communication and facilitating coordination.



NEW PAPER


Impact of COVID-19 on Psychology among the University
Students
Bablu Kumar Dhar,* Foster Kofi Ayittey, and Sabrina Maria Sarkar
The purpose of the study is to find out the psychological impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on university students. The study focuses on the
university students from different public and private universities of
Bangladesh through a set of questionnaires according to the guideline
of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The result among 15 543
respondents shows that 44.59% are suffering from severe anxiety, 48.41%
moderate anxiety, and only 3.82% mild anxiety. The results highlight that
all epidemic-related stressors are positively correlated with the level of
anxiety. Among the epidemic-related stressors, worry about economic
influences during and after COVID-19 (r = 0.342, p < 0.001) and worry about
the influence of COVID-19 on daily life (r = 0.340, p < 0.001) have a highly
positive impact on the level of anxiety. Following these stressors, worry about
academic delays due to COVID-19 (r = 0.326, p < 0.001) and worry about the
social support during COVID-19 (r = 0.321, p < 0.001) have moderately and
positively correlated with the level of anxiety. The study suggests that proper
government support, as well as social awareness, should be monitored
during epidemics for decreasing anxiety and maintaining a good mental
health of the university students.
1. Introduction
In 2020, the current population density of Bangladesh is 1115.55 
people per square kilometer, which is a 1.01% increase than last 
year. Because of the density of population, Bangladesh is the 
12th most densely populated country in the world.[1]
 According 
to the report of the World Economic Forum, COVID-19 threatens to cause a humanitarian crisis in 
this country. According to the World Bank 
data, in Bangladesh, 15% of workers earn 
more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day and the 
economic shutdown sparked by COVID-19 
endangers millions of livelihoods imminently. The people could meet their 
daily expenditures, sent their children to 
school, and expected that they could save 
money for an emergency health crisis. 
The majority of villagers depend on remittances from the cities or overseas. However, for the current global crisis, people 
are out of work. Income has halted.
Based on the report of the Reuters, the 
COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to 
have spread to Bangladesh on March 2020 
after recognizing the first three known 
cases reported on March 7, 2020, by the 
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control 
and Research (IEDCR) of the country.[2]
According to IEDCR, Bangladesh, the 
level of infections remained low at the end 
of March, although there was a precipitous 
rise in April. In the week ending April 16, new cases in Bangladesh grew 1155%, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia with 
186%. As of June 3, 2020, there are a total of 57 563 confirmed 
cases besides 12 161 recovered and 781 death cases.
The novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) is spreading faster all 
over the country. The current situation imposes massive pressure on the government of Bangladesh, the general public, and 
healthcare, and medical providers.[3]
 The pandemic has brought 
not only the danger of death from the epidemiologic contagion but also an intolerable psychological burden to the people 
among the world[4,5]
 and Bangladesh is not out of the problems. The faster spread of the virus; strict isolation measures; 
and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across 
the country are anticipated to influence the psychology of university students.[6]
 Psychological reports indicate the influence 
of the epidemic on the children, public, older adults, medical 
staff, and patients.[7–9]
 However, no thorough research on the 
psychology of university students facing the epidemic has been 
conducted to date.
Like other sectors, the education sector has been affected 
severely in Bangladesh. On March 17, 2020, the government 
closed all schools, colleges, and universities when Bangladesh 
had eight confirmed cases. Among 853  267 students out of 
104  universities in Bangladesh, the number of public universities is 33 with 454  530 students, and the number of private 
universities is 71 with 398  737 students. The average student count for a public university is 13  774, and 5616 for a private 
university that indicates that there are 8204 students per university. Having a vast number of undergraduate, graduate, and 
postgraduate students, the country wishes a secure future that 
has been temporary collapsed due to the current pandemic.
For detecting anxiety disorders, the seven-item Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is one of the extensively used 
tools that is easy to score and takes less than 1–3 min to finish.[6]
Moreover, the GAD-7 is also applicable for diagnosis, screening, 
and the valuation of the strictness of anxiety disorders, and also 
for panic disorders, stress disorders, post-traumatic disorders, 
and social phobia.[10]
The prior problem of the students of university is mostly 
related to their career and future. Due to the uncertainty, stress 
increases among university students;[11]
 hence, the method of 
supervisory university students during public health crises is 
different and challenging. Therefore, the study aimed to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among 
university students in Bangladesh. Moreover, the study intends 
to provide suggestions to the government and non-government 
organizations for taking the necessary steps.
2. Results
2.1. Demographic Statistics
Table 1 shows the demographic and particular characteristics 
of the population of the study. The table indicates the 15 543 
university students, most of the respondents are male (66.7%), 
approximately two-thirds of them live in the urban area (76.1%), 
most of their financial status is not steady (61.6%), majority 
of the participants live with their parents (78.1%), and many 
of their relatives or friends are not infected with COVID-19 
(87.4%). However, 12.6% of the relatives or friends of the 
respondents have been infected by the virus.
2.2. Anxiety Level among University Students during the 
Outbreak
Table 2 demonstrates the psychological health of university 
students who have been affected during the epidemic. It is 
shocking to observe that most of the students are at a high 
level of anxiety, and their psychological condition is alarming. 
Among 15 543 students, a very few number of students are in 
normal (3.18%) and mild (3.82%) level of anxiety. However, 
nearly half of the students are at a moderate level of anxiety 
(48.41%), and the rest of them are suffering from very high or 
severe level (44.59%) of anxiety.
2.3. Influencing Factors of Anxiety among University Student 
during the Outbreak
2.3.1. Univariate Analysis
The association between the demographic variables and the 
level of nervousness or anxiety among Bangladeshi university 
students are pointed in Table 3. The analysis shows that all factors have a significant effect on anxiety. During the epidemic, 
gender has a significant effect on anxiety (p < 0.05) and males 
are severely worried (16.88%) than female during the epidemic; 
place of residence in the urban area has a significant impact on 
anxiety and living in the urban area creates moderate anxiety 
(18.79%) than rural areas; living with their parents has a substantial consequence on anxiety and students who live alone 
has amplified anxiety level (p < 0.05). On the other hand, 
financial condition, and the infection of COVID-19 among 
relatives or friends have the most significant effect on anxiety 
(p < 0.001).
2.3.2. Ordinal Regression Analysis
Table 4 points out the consequences of ordinal multivariate 
analysis of related influences with anxiety level through the 
epidemic among the university students of Bangladesh. Significant influences from the univariate analysis comprised in 
the analysis of ordered logistic regression (OLR) in the table. 
The model test indicates that the value of odds ratio (OR) of all 
variables was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 
chi-square test (χ2 = 14.170) of the observed values indicates a 
good model fit. Results from the OLR analysis of the factors 
that influence anxiety level among university students indicate 
that “living in urban areas” causes more anxiety (OR = 1.940; 
CI = 1.830, –2.740); unstable financial condition causes more

worry in comparison with stable financial condition (OR = 2.920; 
CI = 1.910, –3.540); living without parents increases nervousness level (OR = 1.270; CI = 0.850, 1.730); and infected relatives 
or friends with novel coronavirus enhance anxiety’s risk factor 
(OR = 3.750; CI = 2.950, –3.980).
2.3.3. Correlation between the Level of Anxiety and 
Epidemic-Related Stressors
Table 5 indicates the result of the correlation analysis between 
the level of anxiety and COVID-19 epidemic-related stressors, 
including worry about economic influences, worry about 
academic delays, worry about the influence of COVID-19 on 
daily life, and worry about the social support during COVID-19. 
The results highlight that all epidemic-related stressors are positively associated with the level of anxiety. Among the epidemicrelated stressors, worry about economic influences during 
and after COVID-19 (r = 0.342, p < 0.001) and worry about the 
influence of COVID-19 on daily life (r = 0.340, p < 0.001) have 
a highly positive impact on the level of anxiety level. Following 
these stressors, worry about academic delays due to COVID-19 
(r = 0.326, p < 0.001) and worry about the social support during 
COVID-19 (r = 0.321, p <  0.001) are moderately and positively 
connected with the level of anxiety.
3. Discussion
According to previous studies, public health emergencies have 
several psychological effects on students who study in higher 
educational institutions. According to Cornine,[12]
 college students’ anxiety is connected to the consequence of the virus. 
Bao et al.[13]
 mentioned that the growing number of infected and

suspected patients has increased anxiety level among students. 
Ayittey et  al.[14,15]
 highlighted the significant scarcity of masks 
and sanitizers, and the devastating, astonishing, and erroneous 
news reports in different social media had increased anxiety 
and fear. The study of Cao et  al.[6]
 pointed that the anxiety 
among college students during the epidemic was related with 
their place of residence, source of parental income, whether 
living with parents, and whether a relative or an acquaintance 
was infected with the epidemic without significant difference 
in gender or region that is dissimilar from the conclusions of 
Moreno et  al.[10]
 Cao et  al.[6]
 concluded that male and female 
students have similar stresses and negative emotions as a 
result of COVID-19. The study of Mei at al.[16]
 indicated fear 
and anxiety. Elmer et al.[17]
 and Wang et al.[18]
 focused on future 
employment. Cornine[12]
 emphasized on infection of relatives 
or friends during the epidemic. Kmietowicz[19]
 and Xiao[5]
 highlighted the psychological condition during long interpersonal 
communication.
The foremost intention of the current study was to assess the 
psychological situation of university students during the current 
epidemic, COVID-19, and to explore the influencing factors of 
their anxiety. The study found that almost 97% of the university 
students were experiencing anxiety due to the outbreak of the 
current epidemic. Among the students who participated, 48.41% 
are suffering from a moderate level of anxiety, and 44.59% are 
experiencing a severe level of anxiety. On the other hand, the 
amount of experiencing a mild level of anxiety (3.82%) and not 
feeling anxiousness (3.18%) is very poor in ratio. This current 
study shows an opposite scenario of the study of Cao et  al.[6]
The study of Cao et  al.[6]
 highlighted the psychological condition of college students of China during COVID-19. The study 
of Cao et al.[6]
 indicated that among Chinese students only 0.9% 
experienced severe anxiety and 21.3% experienced mild anxiety 
during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The economy of urban areas is relatively significant and 
delivers citizens with better safety,[20]
 and living in urban areas 
is a protective factor against anxiety.[6]
 There is indeed an inequity of cultural, economic, and education between rural and 
urban areas. For example, hygienic conditions in urban areas 
are healthier than rural, which reduces the chances of surviving and spreading of COVID-19.[21]
 However, the univariate 
analysis and OLR analysis of factors on the level of anxiety 
among the students of universities in Bangladesh show a different scenario. In explanation, the participants mentioned the 
reason of overdensity among the urban areas in Bangladesh. 
Most of the higher educational institutions are in urban areas. 
Due to the reason, a majority of the students live in urban 
areas and experience immense anxiety during the current 
epidemic.
Living without parents was another favorable factor for 
increasing anxiety among students. The current study also 
finds a similar result regarding this factor with the study of 
Cao et al.[6]
 Earlier studies also have specified that the risk factors connected with anxiety and emotional sicknesses among 
adults comprise not living with parents, parents’ physical and 
psychological problems, and the death of parents in infantile,[22]
which are reliable with the results of the present study.
Financial stability or condition matters much on anxiety 
among the students.[6]
 Elmer et  al.,[17]
 also found that the 
constancy of family income has a significant influence on the 
anxiety level of the university students during the COVID-19 
catastrophe.
Higher levels of stress are connected with young age, having 
to go out to work, female gender, and having an acquaintance infected with COVID-19.[23]
 The contemporary study also 
found that having relatives or friends being infected with novel 
coronavirus becomes a risk factor among university students’ 
anxiety during the epidemic. According to the respondents, it 
generates high contagiousness of the COVID-19.[24]
Economic stressors, academic delays, effects on daily life, 
and families or friends being infected with epidemic are 
positively related to anxiety among the university students of 
Bangladesh during the epidemic. Similar studies by Cao et al.[6]
have specified that along with the national health condition, 
COVID-19 also has a substantial influence on the economy of 
the country as well as individuals.[25]
 Bangladesh remains on 
a knife-edge in COVID-19 crisis. The lockdowns prompted by 
the epidemic has already deteriorated the economic and political stability of the country. Due to the outbreak, many families 
are losing their source of income, and students are feeling worried about paying their tuition fees.[26]
 Hunger, malnutrition, 
and other related problems have augmented in Bangladesh as 
a result of the lockdown.[26]
 Like other countries, all primary, 
secondary schools, high schools, colleges, and universities were 
closed and delaying classes until March 17, 2020, which creates 
more anxiety among students. For reducing anxiety regarding 
this issue, using distant/remote learning methods can be a 
good model. These actions certainly have a precise influence on 
education and the development of students.
Social support is also positively correlated with the anxiety 
of the university students of Bangladesh, which is not consistent with previous findings.[6,7]
 According to the participants of the study, social support lessens the mental pressure 
during the epidemic and changes the attitude regarding social 
support that is rare to find in the society by the students. 
The social support in Bangladesh is not run under a single 
umbrella like the developed countries. Even the supports from 
the government are not well enough.[27]
 This consequence 
indicates that active and vigorous social support is essential 
during public health emergencies to reduce the anxiety level 
among the students.
4. Conclusions
Being burdened with population, Bangladesh becomes one of 
the major risky zones during COVID-19 epidemic where financial, physical, and psychological crisis arise in every moment. 
The overall situation creates a deep psychological impact among 
the university students of Bangladesh. About 97% of university students are in deep anxiety due to the current epidemic. 
Living in urban areas, not having a steady financial situation, 
not living with parents, and infection of relatives or friends in 
epidemic become the severe factors for severe anxiety among 
university students during the outbreak of novel coronavirus. 
The stressors of the COVID-19, including economic stressors, 
academic delays, impact on daily life, and social supports, are 
entirely linked with the symptoms of anxiety levels among

the university students of Bangladesh during the epidemic. 
Though the government of Bangladesh is adopting several 
policies regarding this issue, consciousness and preventive 
measurements of the inhabitants of the country according to 
the guidelines of World Health Organization are needed more 
to resolve the critical problem with high priority. Proper government support, as well as social awareness, should be monitored 
during epidemics to decrease anxiety and maintaining the good 
mental health of the university students for crafting a better 
future of the nation.
5. Experimental Section
Study Population and Sample: For the analysis, the study targeted the 
public and private university students of Bangladesh. The respondents 
were selected randomly from different universities in different cities 
in Bangladesh. By using a structured, reliable, and confidential 
questionnaire, the study tried to measure the psychological health of 
the university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total number 
of 15  543 respondents responded (100% response rate) willingly for 
discovering the psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among 
university students in Bangladesh.
Instruments: For finding out the psychological impact on the 
university students of Bangladesh, the study used GAD-7 that comprises 
seven items constructed on seven core symptoms and queries to 
find out the respondents who suffered within the last 2 weeks.[28]
 The 
total score range of the questions was 0–21 followed by a four-point 
Likert scale from 0 to 3 (not at all to almost every day).[6]
 Moreover, 
the study tried to find out the related demographic information of the 
respondents, including gender, place of residence, financial situation, 
living condition, and status of the infection of COVID-19 among their 
relatives or friends. Furthermore, the respondents were queried about 
their thoughts and preventive behaviors, economic conditions, academic 
progress, availability of social support, and influence on daily life 
during the epidemic. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s ɑ) of GAD-7 
is 0.929.
Data Analysis: SPSS (version 25.0) was used to analyze the 
collected data. The study implemented several statistical methods 
to justify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic among the Bangladeshi 
university students, including descriptive statistics to demonstrate 
the demographic features; univariate analysis (nonparametric test) to 
discover the significant relations between sample characteristics and 
anxiety level;[29]
 multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine 
statistical significance among the variables through odds ratio with 95% 
confidence of interval;[6]
 Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) with a 
two-tailed statistical significance (p < 0.05) to assess the connotation 
between novel coronavirus-related stressors and the level of anxiety.
Ethical Considerations: The department of students’ affairs of different 
universities approved this study. The university authorities also felt 
interested to know the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on 
the students. After describing the need of the study, respondents gave 
their consent voluntarily

Psychological aspects
Law enforcement
In December 2019, an unknown Virus starts affecting the human
being from Wuhan seafood market, China due to trade of various animals and birds viz bats, snakes, birds etc. Though exactly the source of
virus is unknown, the Wuhan Institute of Virology declared that it is 96
% identical to Corona Virus found in bats (Anon, 2020g). Initially, it
was believed that this virus was not a communal spread virus. A lot of
people migrated to Wuhan to celebrate their annual Chunyun festival.
This large get together for the festival, cause the virus to spread among
them. Without knowing this, they started to travelled back to their
places. Due to this, the virus starts affecting more than 200 countries
across the globe.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the virus as Covid –
19. The initial symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties
and when it is severe, results in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
syndrome and at last result in loss of life (Anon, 2020h). The stage of
spread of virus include 4 stages. In stage 1, the people are affected when
they are travelling to affected countries. In stage 2, the people who are
very closely interacting with the affected people in stage 1 (Anon,
2020e). In stage 3, community spreads occur and still the disease can be
controlled. In stage 4, the massive number of people are affected and it
is very difficult to control.
In India, though the first case of Corona was reported on 29th
January 2020, the virus starts spreading from 1st week of March 2020.
The Government has taken lot of preventive measure to control the
spread of the virus (Anon, 2020a). As the virus spreads due to the closer
interaction of the people the Government asked their citizens to
maintain Social Distancing. In March 22nd a one-day Janata Curfew, a
voluntary self-quarantine activity was observed nationwide. In March
24th, to stop the pandemic and for the welfare of the people, the
Honourable Prime Minister announced the 21 days Lockdown period
and imposed Section 144 of Cr.P.C. throughout the country (Anon,
2020f). By imposing this lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled
adversely without any further consequences. Also, the Government can
disinfect the public areas and allow the hospitals to prepare themselves
to handle this situation. Accordingly, any person who disobeys the rules
would be definitely punished.
1. Enforcement of law
The Constitution of India is considered to be the back bone of the
Government and all other laws laid down by the Government must not
be ultra vires with the constitution (Anon, 2020b). In case any law that
has been laid is ultra vires then it is considered to be unconstitutional
and not valid.
Article 19 of the Constitution of India states about the fundamental
rights of the Citizen, which include freedom of speech, freedom to go
anywhere in the country, form association or unions, gather at a public
place for a cause without any armour etc. but under certain emergency
and critical time there are certain exceptions to the fundamental rights
that are being exercised by the citizens of India, which are stated in
Article 19(2) to Article 19(6). Under this sub clause it is stated that the
state can impose any law for the welfare of the people in emergency
situation for example natural disaster etc. so it is our duty to follow the
rules and restrictions and restrictions that has been imposed.
There is a special act named Epidemic Disease Act 1897. This act
was specifically laid down for such emergency purposes. According to
this act the centre and state has the discretionary powers to take the
control in their hands to stop further spread of the disease or epidemic
or pandemic. Based on this act the centre and state have the power to
quarantine the people affected with any contagious disease or the
people who are suspected to have the symptoms of the contagious
disease. Or even healthy people to protect them from further spread of
the disease.
When the rules imposed by the government in reference to the
epidemic disease act are not followed properly then the Section 188 of
IPC comes into action. According to this section anyone who disobeys
the law imposed (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public
servant) is subjected to one month of imprisonment or fine of INR200 or
both on general conditions. If the person was the reason for the spread
of the disease to a healthy person or death of a person then he is subjected to imprisonment up to 6 months or fine of INR100 or both.
Disaster Management Act 2005 is another act that is related to the
current situation. Under this act Section 51 states the punishment for
the obstruction caused. According to this any person who disobeys the
rule imposed will be given one year of simple imprisonment and if the
person was responsible for any spread of disease or death then is subjected to imprisonment up to 2 years. Section 54 of the same act states
that if any person creates panic situation due to the spreading of false
information by any means e.g.; sharing any information in Social media
is subjected to imprisonment up to 1 year.

TAccording to the Section 270 of IPC which applies for a “malignant
act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life”. A violator
can be jailed for up to two years or could be fined or both without bail.
Under Section 271 of IPC if a person is tested positive or suspected
to be affected by the disease and are prescribed to be kept in quarantine
and any person who violates the quarantine rule are booked under this
section and imprisonment up to 2 years which is non cognizable.
According to the Essential Commodities Act, the essential commodities that are said to be the basic needs during the emergency and
disaster time must be sold at the price of MRP or at a reasonable cost
based on demand and requirement but selling the essential things at
unreasonable prices is said to be a crime and is subjected to imprisonment up to 7 years.
2. Psychological aspects of people during lockdown period
Due to lockdown, the psychological aspects of people are affected as
follows:
When the Government announces the India is going to be under
Lockdown in the next 4 h, the general public become panic. There was
an ambiguity among the common public whether the essential items
will be available and they started to buy items that are more than required and tried to store the commodities.
To reduce the fear of the Doctors, Nurses and other Healthcare
Workers the Government has declared Insurance for them. In order to
enhance Healthcare to the Nation, the service of the private Hospitals is
also leveraged. The Government is providing permission to setup more
testing facility to identify the infected people and for providing treatment. The MSME ministry has invited the manufacturer and supplier to
produce Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Ventilators, Medical
Equipment for the benefit of Healthcare Professionals and Public. Also,
various training programmes were organised for the healthcare professionals to handle the situation.
For the middle-class people, salaried people, organised sector etc.,
the RBI has reduced the repo rate which results in reduction in loan
interest rate. Also, for the term loans, the customer can opt out 3
months EMI. Also, ATM withdraw fee are waived off. Free LPG cylinders, Free rice / wheat, pulses are provided to the beneficiaries. The
deadlines for income tax returns has been extended. For the Small and
Medium Entrepreneurs, collateral free loans will be provided. The GST
filling dates has been extended.
During this lockdown period, the Migrant Workers were not able to
travel to their native place. To Leverage their fear, the Government has
instructed the Employers has to take care of the employees and to
provide them with food and shelter. The Government has instructed to
pay wages during the lockdown period for their employees. However,
three fourths of Indian population are working in unorganised sectors
and this lockdown may results in financial insecurity for them. Also, the
farmers got mentally stressed for the reason where there are no people
for harvesting their goods. The cultivated products like vegetables,
fruits, flowers, species etc cannot be exported to the foreign national
which will affect their economy.
UGC has issued some guidelines to Higher Education Institutes
(HEIs), to take care of the Mental Health, Psychosocial concerns & WellBeing of Students Community during and after COVID-19 outbreak
(Anon, 2020c). To address this challenge, the Teachers undertook the
Socially responsibility. To improvise the quality of teaching, ICT based
teaching-learning were adopted (Anon, 2020d). In order to keep the
Mental Wellness of the people, the National Institute of Mental Healthiness and Neuro Science has launched a toll-free telephone to counsel
the mental illness of people.
3. Conclusion
The corona outbreak is considered to be a pandemic. The Central
and State Government are taking many precautionary measures and
relief measures for the welfare of people. However, there are people
without unaware of the impact of Corona Virus, unnecessarily moving
around the streets. People become panic with the situation and buying
commodities needed without maintaining Social Distancing as advised
by Government. Without the public cooperation the spread of the virus
cannot be controlled. When the Government orders are violated, then
the Government has to strictly enforce the law. Thus, all are advised to
act wisely and cooperate with the Government to safe guard our lives
and the lives of other people.
Present situation conveys that “Law is the only Medicine (Sec.144 of
Cr.P.C.)”

A highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection, COVID-19, has dramatically
changed the world with a tragically large number of human lives being lost. The epidemic
has created psychological resilience and unbearable psychological pressure among
patients and health professionals. The objective of this study is to analyze investor
psychology and stock market behavior during COVID-19. The psychological behavior of
investors, whether positive or negative, toward the stock market can change the picture
of the economy. This research explores Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock
markets from January 20, 2020, to April 27, 2020, by employing principal component
analysis. The results showed that investor psychology was negatively related to three
selected stock markets under psychological resilience and pandemic pressure. The
negative emotions and pessimism urge investors to cease financial investment in the
stock market, and consequently, the stock market returns decreased. In a deadly
pandemic, the masses were more concerned about their lives and livelihood and less
about wealth and leisure. This research contributes to the literature gap of investors’
psychological behavior during a pandemic outbreak. The study suggests that policymakers should design a plan to fight against COVID-19. The government should
manage the health sector’s budget to overcome future crises.

INTRODUCTION
The terminology of “Corona” is not newly invented in science. This single-stranded RNA
virus’ primary roots were observed in 1960, belonging to the Corona viridae family in the
order Nidovirales (Galante et al., 2016; Kanwar et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2020; Mohsin et al.,
2020b). The taxonomic naming comes from the virus’ structure, which gives the appearance
of crown-like spikes on the virus’ outer surface (Azam et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020c;
Shereen et al., 2020). The prey of the first coronavirus species was chicken and pig; there
was no human–human transmission. From 1960 to 2020, different allied versions of the
same family of viruses have been observed: the common cold in adults (COV 229E and
COV OC43 in mid-1960); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2003);
human coronavirus with common cold, bronchitis, and asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary

disease (COPD) exacerbations; pneumonia (HCOV NL63-2004
and CoV-HKU1); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS
CoV-2012); and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus19 (SARS-CoV-2019 or SARS-CoV-2), displaying unmatched
intensity and severity compared to the previous species of corona
(Van Der Hoek et al., 2004; Kahn and McIntosh, 2005; Woo
et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2006; Zaki et al., 2012). At the start
of the virus breakout, the virus name was 2019-nCOV as per
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),
and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CCDC) changed it into SARS-CoV-2 on January 7, 2020 due to
its structure and symptoms. COVID-19 was first discovered in
Wuhan’s wet market, Hubei Province, China, in early December
2019, and this aroused global attention in late January 2020.
The virus has been spreading exponentially, using human-tohuman transmission through respiratory droplets, i.e., sneezing
and coughing (Azam et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al.,
2020a; Shereen et al., 2020). During this incubation period,
researchers focused on exploring, preventing, and treating
patients. Still, the pandemic’s psychological impact is the other
side of the disease (mental illness). The global quarantine
announcement has sparked several concerns: fear of separation
from family, fear of illness and death, avoidance of medical
facilities due to threat of infection, fear of unemployment, the
threat of racism against people who live in or are perceived
to be from the affected areas, fear of losing near and dear
ones because of the virus, maintained space from minors
and disabled or elderly family members due to infection,
isolation, and recalling the severity of the treatment of infected
people. These have become originators of anxiety, stress, and
grave concern globally. These mental health aspects of the
COVID-19 outbreak have affected individual lives as well as the
financial markets.
Human Psychology and COVID-19
The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has seriously influenced
human psychology through a notable mental state of “anxiety.”
The term “anxiety” covers the population’s reaction toward the
epidemic to all media, whether the information is authentic
or erroneous, e.g., inappropriate behavior of people concerning
the abandonment of animals and panic buying of other foods.
The panic attacks are not properly defined without linkage to
anxiety disorder in the medical sense. Anxiety is a combination
of different psychiatric disorders both internal (phobias, panic
attacks, and panic disorder) and external (worry, stress, fear,
painful experiences, or events). The psychological effect of
COVID-19’ has led to mass hysteria, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The behavioral
immune system (BIS) theory, stress theory, and perceived risk
theory explain that negative emotion (anxiety, aversion) and
negative cognitive assessment of human beings are developed
for self-protection. People tend to develop avoidant behavior
and strictly follow the social norms due to the pandemic’s
severe effects and the potential threat of disease (Cao et al.,
2020; Lai et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020b). The anxiety, stress,
and panic attacks of people due to COVID-19 have created
two etiologies. The first is the identification of symptoms of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as cough
and dyspnea, at high frequency (Preter and Klein, 2008;
Javelot and Weiner, 2020). The second one is “false alarming”
(Klein, 1993) as a psychopathological link to the catastrophic

interpretation of physiological sensation (respiration rate). The
recurrence of panic attacks has increased the respiration rate
and has become the reason for excessively avoidant behaviors
and blind conformity (Li et al., 2020; Mohsin et al., 2020a).
Psychopathology is a keen concern for this study because it has
an intense effect on investor behavior. Stock market investors
and business people generally spend most of their time in the
workplace. However, they are currently mostly homebound;
the present situation of the stock markets, investment decision
pressure, and family members’ psychological health now put
pressure on investor psychology.
Investors’ Psychology (Sentiments),
Stock Market, and COVID-19
The COVID-19 outbreak has threatened every individual
field of life to influence public health. The sustainability of
the global stock market and financial markets also carries
significant repercussions (Ali et al., 2020; Huang and Zheng,
2020). Being a part of the societal system, investor psychology
(sentiments) and their optimism or pessimism about future stock
prices can also change. A sharp decrease has been observed
in Shanghai, Dow Jones, and Nikkei’s stock prices due to
investor sentiment volatility during the pandemic outbreak (see
Figure 1). The visual presentation of Figure 1 has shown a
sudden downward trend in stock markets after the outbreak
of the pandemic.
Existing literature has focused on the relationship between
stock prices and investor sentiment. Lee et al. (2002) and Brown
and Cliff (2004) explained that the past market returns are
important sentiment determinants, while investor sentiment
changes significantly correlated with the contemporary
market return. The positive relationship between stock
markets and sentiment will confirm that investor sentiment
is a contrarian predictor for consequent market returns.
Meanwhile, the sentiment impact is stronger if easy (hard)
to value stocks are negatively (positively) influenced by
sentiments (Baker and Wurgler, 2007; Xiang et al., 2020).
Using the component of market index return, which is
avoidant of fundamental macroeconomic factors, Lan et al.
(2020) observed robust evidence that the pre-announcement
abnormal return derives from investor sentiment. The sentiment
determined overvaluation corrects within 1 month in the postannouncement period. The market timers tackle this sentiment
situation and take advantage of issuing season shares. The
stock price sensitivity in terms of the good news of earning is
higher during a high sentiment period. In contrast, in a low
sentiment period, the stock price sensitivity behaves negatively.
As per analysis suggestions, the investor sentiment becomes
the reason for the general mispricing of stock because of
sentient-driven mispricing of earning contributions (Schmeling,
2009; Zouaoui et al., 2011; Mian and Sankaraguruswamy, 2012;
Cheema et al., 2020). The high market competition indicated
that sentiments and returns are positively related to each other,
and this relationship disappears in low market competition.
Although the financial crisis changes the situation irrespective
of market competition, a positive relationship exists between
sentiments and returns (Ryu et al., 2020). Investors can accept
psychological pressure more sensitively and intensively than
the lay person. Apart from the pandemic’s rapid spread, the
financial news, media, and amplifiers have worked as fear
spreaders about COVID-19. Tetlock (2007) elucidated that
spread of news about the stock market strongly affects investor
psychology and sociology. The high media pessimism leads to
downward pressure on market prices and vice versa. The investor
sentiment theory also confirmed the consistent relationship
between media content and individual investor behavior with
disproportionately small stocks. This research is based on a
new ideology of investor psychology and the stock market
during the pandemic. There have been few studies in this area,
but a bulk of research centers on both human psychology
and COVID-19 as well as the stock market and COVID-19.
Under the caption of investor psychology, the stock market,
and COVID-19, we tried to explain this research’s nature
and relationship.
The psychological pressure negatively impacts investors and
investing decisions, which can decline any individual country’s
economy. This study analyzed investor psychology and stock
market behavior during COVID-19—a comparatively new debate
about COVID-19. This research will contribute to the existing
literature and open up new dimensions in understanding
investor sentiment toward investment decisions in the stock

market under special circumstances during the outbreak of
pandemics and times of intense anxiety. Our research differs
from previous studies in the use of proxies of investor
sentiment as indicators of the stock market and COVID-19.
The strong theoretical upbringing of psychological behavior and
the dynamic process of stock price fluctuation will deepen the
understanding of readers, investors, and researchers. A sample
of three different stock markets will help elaborate on investors’
psychological and geographical sensation during investment
decisions in a pandemic.
DATA DESCRIPTION AND
METHODOLOGY
Data Description
Our research includes daily observations of three different stock
markets, i.e., Shanghai stock market, Nikkei, and Dow Jones,
from January 20 to April 27, 2020. The market selection is based
on two reasons. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on investor
sentiment during the pandemic, i.e., the Shanghai Stock Market
(China). The second is to check the global impact by using Nikkei
and Dow Jones. The reason behind the selected data span is the
global spread of COVID-19. The sample period starts from the
data declaration of all sample markets because the synchronized
data lead to accurate results. The data are collected from stock
markets in China, Japan, and the United States. The analyzed data
are secondary and publically available on mentioned databases,
i.e., Bloomberg for stock markets data and WHO for COVID-19.
Methodology
The Sentiment Index (SMI) model used in this research is

Stock Exchange Turnover Ratio
The stock market’s trading activity can be measured by turnover
ratio; subsequently, it is used in the primary measurement model.
Ying (1966) and Rehman et al. (2017) have explained that more
considerable turnover is an indication of a rise in stock prices
(Bullish Market), while small turnover reflects a fall in stock
prices (Bearish Market). The stock exchange turnover ratio is
calculated by using the following equation:
STURN = 100 ×
VMDaily
VMMonthly
(2)
where VMDaily is used for daily volume, VMMonthly is the average
volume of the month, and STURN is calculated using a running
or moving basis, which means the previous dropping value and
adding the next one.
Money Flow Index
The MFI comprises daily stock prices and turnover information.
An increase in money flow indicates the market trend. The

whereas the rise in the falling trend increases the selling
pressure. The following formula is used to calculate
the MFI:

Money Flow = Daily Prices × Turnover (4)
When the current day price is higher than the previous day,
the money flow is positive, while there is a comparatively
lower current day price than the previous day, the money
flow is negative (Tolonen, 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Marek
and Marková, 2020). The daily MFI has been calculated as
follows:
MFI =

Relative Strength Index
The technical analysis used the RSI, a momentum indicator that
measures the magnitude of recent price changes, to evaluate
the oversold or overbought condition in stock or other asset
prices (Russell, 1978; Wilder, 1978; Russell and Franzmann,
1979; Ivascu and Cioca, 2019). An oscillator is a display board
of RSI between two extremes (low and high with a range
of 0–100). Suppose the oscillator shows an upward trend
with RSI ≥ 70 value, meaning that a security is overbought
or overvalued. In that case, a positive but downward trend
with RSI ≤ 30 value indicates an oversold or undervalued
condition.

The changes in daily confirmed and death cases of COVID19 are used to capture investor mood swings regarding
the spreading pandemic. This term was used by Chen
et al. (2010, 2014) to check the impact of market index

Relationship Between Stock Market Index and
Investor Sentiment
The SMI regressed on the stock market volatility series during
COVID-19. The following regression equation checks the
respective sentiment and market return relationship:
Ym,t−1,i = α + βlnSMIm,t−1,i (9)
Ym,t−1 is the market return of the stock market’s indicator
concerning time, while SMIm,t−1,i
is the Sentiment Index. The
calculation of Ym,t−1 is done by the following equation:
Rm,t,i = 100 ∗ Log 

In this equation, Pt
is the current market price (closing), and Pt−1
is the preceding market price (closing).
RESULTS
Principle Component Analysis
The principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to extract
meaningful information from multivariate data (orthogonal
linear transformation) and present the information in the form
of a set of new variables by use of scalar projections, which are
called principal components (PC). The total number of PCs is
less than or equal to the original number of variables. That is
why the new variables or PCs are known as a linear combination

of actual variables. The PCs are used as direction identifiers and
correspond to the total variation of the data set. The multivariate
data dimensionality reduces by using PCA with minimal loss of
information. The eigenvalues explained that every PC retains the
amount of variation. The division of variation between PCs as
the eigenvalues is large for first PCs and small for subsequent
ones. The first PC, or the PC with more than one eigenvalue, was
used to check the correlation because of the increased variation
retention of the data set.
Shanghai Stock Market
The principal component analysis of the selected variable for the
Shanghai Stock Market is presented in Tables 1, 2. According to
Kaiser Criterion, the principle component with an eigenvalue not
less than 1 will be used (Yeomans and Golder, 1982; Braeken
and Van Assen, 2017; Rehman et al., 2017). The eigenvalue of
PC-1 is 2.0545, which meets the criteria of maximal variation.
The numeric presentation of PC-1 shows 41.09% of the Shanghai
Stock Market relationship, which is the highest value compared
to other principal components. The following index was created
by using the first principle component:
SMISSE,t = −0.0584STURN + 0.1759MFI + −0.1244RSI +
0.68811CC + 0.69041CD
The relationship between Shanghai stock returns and the
created SMI is graphically presented in Figure 2.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 3, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The multicollinearity check is essential for the accuracy
of results because inter-correlation among independent variables
in a multiple regression model can mislead the results. When
the regressor shows a value of more than 0.80, then the data
series shows multicollinearity. The correlation matrix range for
the Shanghai Stock Market is from −0.0991 to 0.8018, ensuring
the data series is free from multicollinearity.

Nikkei 225 Stock Market
The PCA of the selected variable for the Nikkei 225 stock market
is presented in Tables 4, 5. According to Kaiser Criterion, the
principle component with an eigenvalue not less than 1 will be
used (Yeomans and Golder, 1982; Braeken and Van Assen, 2017;
Rehman et al., 2017). The eigenvalue of PC-1 for the Nikkei
225 stock market is 1.8735, which captures maximum variation
and gets the full support of Kaiser Criterion. The cumulative
proportion value of PC-1 shows 37.47% of the Nikkei 225 stock
market relationship with a set of selected variables. The following
index was created by using the first principle component:
SMIN225,t = 0.6844STURN + −0.1786MFI + −0.6003RSI
+ − 0.13801CC + 0.34691CD
The relationship of Shanghai stock returns and created SMI is
graphically presented in Figure 3.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 6, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The range of correlation matrix for the Nikkei 225
stock market is between −0.0991 and 0.8008, which rejects the
existence of multicollinearity.
Dow Jones Stock Market
The PCA of the selected variable for the Dow Jones stock market
is presented in Tables 7, 8. The eigenvalue of PC-1 is 1.7291,

cumulative proportion value of PC-1 shows 34.58% of the Dow
Jones stock market relationship with chosen variables, which is
the highest value among all principal components. The following
index was created using the first principle component:
SMIDJ,t = −0.2275STURN + −0.1650MFI − 0.1960RSI
+0.67981CC + 0.64841CD
The relationship between Dow Jones stock returns and the
created SMI is graphically presented in Figure 4.
The correlation matrix results are displayed in Table 9, which
is employed to check the multicollinearity among independent
variables. The importance of multicollinearity is observed
because inter-correlation among independent variables in a
multiple regression model can betray the results. The range of
the correlation matrix for the Dow Jones stock market is from
−0.0367 to 0.6135, which guarantees the data series free from
multicollinearity.
The regression results are presented in Table 10, which
shows the coefficient (β) −0.2532, −0.2532, and −0.0264 as the
value of the SMI with 0.0056, 0.0056, and 0.0000 probability
values for Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock markets,
respectively. According to this study, the SMI is negative and
significantly related to stock returns at a 1% level of significance
(Baker and Wurgler, 2007; Chen et al., 2014). The importance
of SMI explicated that investor sentiments are strongly affected
by volatility and investment decision of the stock market during
the pandemic. The results have also shown the negative impact of
COVID-19 on investor sentiment and stock market returns. The
spreading pandemic disturbs the general public’s daily routines
and interrupts stock markets, financial markets, and investor
psychology toward investment decisions.
DISCUSSION
After the pandemic outbreak and the WHO’s classification of it
as a public health emergency, investors’ psychological pressure

and response showed a downward trend in stock markets. The
sudden reduction in Shanghai (1.6%), Dow and Jones (9.5%),
and Nikkei (10.6%) can be observed in Figure 1. The numerical
facts of stock markets are collected from Bloomberg’s official
site, and the investor sentiment is generated using different
proxies. The selected proxies represent different circumstances
that might be affected the psychological behavior and decision
power of investors. In this research, daily data of stock markets
and increase in COVID-19 (death and confirmed cases) are
used, accurately covering investors’ daily psychological pressure.
The PCA is employed due to its useful features: correlation
removal, improved algorithm performance, repaired overfitting
among variables, and reduction of high dimensions into low
dimensions for clear visualization of every single component. The
research results elucidated a negative and significant relationship
between investor psychology and investment decision under
pandemic outbreaks for all selected markets. The stock market
movement along the investor SMI in Figures 2–4 has shown
the beneficial relationship between investor psychology and
stock market returns. The investors or business people were
generally outbound for 10–15 h per day. During pandemic,
however, they were homebound, which affected their psychology
adversely. This research provides some precautionary measures
for releasing the pandemic and investment pressure. Investors
should adopt behavior therapy—home-based relaxation exercises
to control their anxiety and depression. The small-scale version
of their official stock market setup should be established in their
homes, and visits to the offices should be reduced. The global
paramedical staff and scientists are continually struggling to
elucidate the vaccines. Until they succeed, everyone should follow
the precautions, i.e., wearing a mask, sanitizing, and maintaining
distance in workplaces and the like. The less psychological control
or pressure can help investors invest money and keep stock
markets and economies on track.
CONCLUSION
The origin of the current “COVID-19” pandemic is considered
to be the wet market of Hunan, Hubei Province, China. Within
1 month from its evolution, COVID-19 has spread to 109
countries, and the pandemic has gained intense global attention.
The sudden outbreak of the pandemic and the rapid increase of
its spread have left a significant impact on human physiology and
psychology. The psychological effect disrupts the psychology of
the general public and investor psychology toward stock market
investment decisions. The increasing number of cases and deaths
worldwide due to COVID-19 has made the economic situation
more uncertain and unpredictable. A sudden and dramatic
downward trend in financial markets is observed in Chinese
and global financial markets, such as Shanghai, Nikkei 225,
and Dow Jones, which are down by −1.6, 10.6, and −9.5%
points, respectively. There are no promising clinical treatments
or prevention strategies developed against COVID-19 until now,
threatening human psychology. At the same time, healthcare
workers are searching for a solution to the question of vaccination
against COVID-19 and psychiatrist-designed psycho-therapeutic
strategies to cope with the threat, stress, and anxiety of the
pandemic, which have a devastating effect on daily life.
This research paper examined the relationship between the
stock market and investor psychology regarding stock market
investment decisions during the pandemic. By employing PCA,
this research observed a downward trend in stock markets
and the pandemic’s negative impact on investor sentiment.
This investigation confirmed the economic crises in the
Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock markets during
the pandemic. The results have pointed out that the threat of
health strongly affected the psychology of investors. The created
SMI behaved negatively with a significance of 1% for three
selected markets. The three selected markets represented three
different world areas with diverse geographical backgrounds,
financial positions, cultures, resources, and traditions to check
global investor behavior. The significant relationship between
the SMI and the stock market during a pandemic confirmed
that the behavior of almost every nation fighting COVID-19
and investor financial behavior is the same across China and
other developed countries. This study concluded that health
crises and psychological disorders among the general public affect
the economic condition and financial position of individual and
global investors.
Limitations and Suggestions
The pandemic is still under discussion, and healthcare workers
are trying to find a solution to the issue of vaccination. It is

doubtlessly tough to run global systems, such as the stock market,
from the workers’ individual homes, but to stop working due
to anxiety or psychological threat is also not the solution to
the problem. Investor sentiment creates tremendous uncertainty
for stock markets and commensurate with a potential crisis of
scale and speed. The governments and policy-makers should
have to set some domestic and international policies for this
unpredictable situation for workplaces. The pandemic is a
worldwide issue, but the courageous actions of governments,
global citizens, policy-makers, healthcare workers, scientists, and
investors can enable us to overcome this global crisis.

Sport psychology services to professional athletes: working
through COVID-19
Fandom around the world yearns for sports entertainment. Much of the discussions within the
recent flurry of sport and exercise psychology writings have been focused on the challenging
experiences of potential Olympians during an Olympic year. Indeed, the 2020 Olympics is an
entertainment event like few others across sport levels.
Within a previous editorial titled “Sport Psychology Services to High-Performance Athletes
During Covid-19”, our Co-Editors from the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology
invited several renowned experts from the international amateur sport community to join us in
a dialog regarding how amatuer athletes from various national teams experienced their journeys through COVID-19. The editorial revealed convergences, though also idiosyncrasies in
how team training during the time of the pandemic has been undertaken within centralised
programs. The recent Olympic editorial can be found at the following link: https://doi.org/10.
1080/1612197X.2020.1754616.
The International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology is committed to advancing open
dialogs regarding all forms of sport and physical activity. The intention is to contribute to a
healthier world, through better evidence-based theory to practice. The IJSEP continues to
welcome all authors seeking to contribute to COVID-19 discussions to submit their scholarship,
emphasising the impacts of the pandemic on sport and physical activity participants, as well as
those who support them with psychological services.
Within this editorial, we have shifted our gaze to professional sport. Professional sport,
unlike Olympic sport, is accessible to viewership every year. There are a vast number of professional team and individual sports that attract viewership, whilst inspiring populations
within and across national boundaries. Akin to our recently aforementioned editorial, the
current editorial is accessible to you for free. Our composition of authorship in this editorial
is also diverse in sport representation. Given the large number of professional sports known
within our global community, the current contributors were narrowed to experts with vast
experience working in professional baseball (MLB – Charles Maher), golf (PGA, LPGA – Rich
Gordin), basketball (NBPA – William Parham), cricket (Stewart Cotterill), soccer (NFA –
Carsten Hvid Larsen), and one of our editors, who is actively involved in combat sport
(boxing, mixed martial arts, kick boxing – Robert Schinke). These experts have collaborated
to augment wider perspectives about professional sport athletes in a pandemic.
The contributors consider their recent and current approaches in active work with professional sport clients, following a sequence: (a) once professional sporting events stopped,
(b) current approaches in their work with professional athletes, and (c) a brief, broader reflection. What we hope the reader will find is that both temporal stages and the final conclusion
indicate growth opportunities for consultants and professional sport clients, alike. One of the
contributors was recently in a multisport mental performance consultant video session, and
a participant suggested that the current state of affairs in relation to elite athletes is being
experienced primarily as a tragic loss. Such a narrative might tell part of how athletes regard
the current moment in their careers, but it does not tell the full story, or for that matter, a

https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2020.1766182mentally healthy story of the opportunities and teachable moments before us. We draw on the
structure directly above to inform the narrative of this editorial.
Emergence of the pandemic
During mid-March 2020, professional sports around the world were in preparation and performance scheduling. Sport as business took an immediate turn, with imminent closures and
the inability for athletes, coaches, managers, and mental performance consultants to continue
their onsite roles within their organisations. Our contributors were involved in developing (a)
action plans to accomplish the closure of training settings; (b) communicating the delicate
decision of closure to players and staff, who were well aware that their seasons were trending
toward a stoppage; and (c) for those who were working in cities away from their families, providing clients with health and safety travel guidelines as they made arrangements to return to
their home residences.
The ripple effect of an abrupt stoppage, or crisis transition, is known to leave athletes and
coaches with psychological and emotional challenges. At a population level, where athletes are
included, there are increased cases in domestic violence, suicide, and bigotry. One highly publicised challenge we understand is that each athlete is unique in her/his engagement with
social isolation. Though challenges with social distancing have been encountered worldwide,
much has been written in cultural sport psychology identifying variations in collective and individual approaches within and across cultures. Certain cultures and nationalities are formal in
terms of socially accepted distance, where people other than close family naturally maintain
extensive physical distance, such as six feet. There are also Hispanic and Latino cultures
where social exchanges are encountered at a closer physical distance, where people are normally demonstrative through hugs and kisses with friends and colleagues, beyond family
(Schinke, Hanrahan, & Catina, 2009). We cannot assume that even in a single Major League
Baseball franchise, professional boxing management group, cricket, or soccer team, that all athletes have experienced the required transition to formal cultural distance in the same way.
Some are more comfortable and some are ill at ease with social distancing.
Based on what we know from athlete identity research and practice, and our own
practical exposures, high-performance athletes, amateur and professional alike, emphasise
their athletic identities. Within professional sport, there are individual differences in terms of
how much emphasis is placed on an athletic identity as compared to the number of identities
that comprise one’s personhood. Many of our clients have families and partners, and some
have side businesses and enterprises. However, we do recognise that professional athletes
derive gainful employment from their sporting activities. Consequently the emphasis on an
athletic identity is often heavily weighted, perhaps disproportionately. Due to any athlete’s
long-term commitment to sport excellence at the highest level, some players rarely explore
other roles and contexts and, as a result, suffer from identity foreclosure and an overly
narrow, singular identity (Nesti & Littlewood, 2011), which is counter-productive during a pandemic due to social isolation.
The challenges that flow from an overly weighted athletic identity, then, can include
increased possibilities of anxiety, depression, addictions, and other mental health concerns
(Henriksen, Schinke, Moesch, McCann, Parham, Larsen & Terry, 2019). Exemplifying our point,
between March 22 and April 14, the percentage of professional soccer players reporting symptoms of depression doubled. FIFPRO and affiliated national player associations surveyed 1602
professional soccer players in countries that had implemented drastic measures to contain the
spread of the COVID-19 such as home-confinement. One thousand one hundred and thirty-four
male players, with a mean age of 26, and 468 female players, with a mean age of 23, took part in
410 EDITORIALthe survey. Twenty-two percent of women players and 13 percent of men players reported
symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Eighteen percent of the women and
16 percent of the men reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of generalised
anxiety (FIFPRO, 2020).
Just as there are identity challenges associated with a pandemic, like every other unforeseen
transition, there exist possibilities for personal enrichment. A pause for thought, albeit, in this
case a lengthier one than first might have been anticipated, is often assumed to be inertia in a
motivated, goal-directed athlete. The holistic opportunities for growth abound in such
moments. Time away from extensive and longstanding training commitments and travel
afford professional athletes time to develop their personal identities, existing relationships,
and explore a breadth of interests, beyond sport. The immediate pause was an opportunity
to nourish relationships, whilst nourishing one’s self.
Counterbalanced with the opportunity to reconnect has been for some, a recognition that
their playing contracts in the short-term were in peril. For example, a boxer is compensated
after each bout – no bouts, no income. With younger professionals who were less financially
heeled, discussions related to financial constraints layered on a further dimension of stress.
Several of the younger athletes with lesser contracts returned home and are presently residing
with parents or extended family. There is a second group of athletes we identified that are presently living alone. These athletes are even more socially isolated than those surrounded by
family members. Finally, athletes on the cusp of financial independence, with young families
of their own, continue to struggle as they await loosened restrictions and the inevitable reconceptualisation of what professional training and subsequent sporting events will be like, with
fewer fans in seats. Questions linger among athletes in terms of interruptions to existing career
paths, and associated, their financial livelihood. These questions could apply more deeply to
athletes residing in developing countries, where finances are perhaps, less available.
Current interventions
There is consensus among the authors that in order to work effectively with clients, we have
needed to develop an organic approach. The logical question we all have asked the athletes
is what exactly they are looking for in terms of support during this pandemic moment.
Some initially were uncertain in terms of how to respond to such an open-ended approach,
enveloped in an unfamiliar circumstance – COVID-19. These athletes now reside at home,
they are not among their peers, and they do need to feel that they are trending positively in
terms of their athletic careers. What follows are a few approaches we have integrated into
our work; some sport specific, some holistic. These approaches have been undertaken
through online means, such as the regular use of video platforms, and chat discussions and
forums with individuals and teams.
Our work is founded on the premise that athletes will best relate to structured communication and contact. Athletes, akin to all high-performance career professionals, evolve based
on logical short- and long-term plans. Their career pathways need to make sense, and each
needs to flow logically toward outcomes that can be parlayed into improved, consistent performance and viability into the future. The accountability in terms of planning must rest
with each athlete in terms of thoughts, emotions, and actions. When an athlete is invested
in self-improvement, he/she will allocate and schedule regular times within each week to
work on one’s mental game. Rarely is there the time to reflect with the guidance of a
mental performance consultant, perhaps in collaboration with a coaching staff member, to
identify existing gaps, and derive short-term plans that will compliment existing strengths.
Weekly scheduled small group discussions with key support staff members, followed by
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY 411individual sessions with key providers, will lead to advancement in player development. Hence,
the immediate time at home can become treasured, not only in terms of what it offers personally and interpersonally but also in terms of unanticipated – newfound gains in sport-specific
skills.
Underlying regular support is an opportunity for the mental performance consultant to
forge a strengthened relationship with each athlete. During pre-season and in season, athletes
are focused on securing their positions, the immediacy of performance, and collaborating with
coaches and teammates. Proactive sport psychology work is often associated with player
access – something that can become challenging and scarce in professional sport. Alternately,
assigned tasks are often reactionary, based on immediate setbacks or struggles. During the
current moment, there is time to become further acquainted with each athlete’s uniqueness
as a person, and then, in terms of how that person comes forth to training and competition.
Reciprocally, the athlete has the time to learn about the mental performance consultant, in
terms of discussions around values and where and how the athlete’s gaps might coincide
with the practitioner’s skills. The work that ensues is then deepened through mutual understanding and a strengthened relationship, leading into the future and the anticipated return
to play.
The specifics that underpin each mental performance consultant’s work will vary depending
on each athlete’s needs and the path that is set toward valued progression(s). We have undertaken exercises focused on mindfulness, guided performance imagery, the re-setting of goals,
revisiting of competition plans, affirmation exercises, and broader holistic life balance and
values- related discussions. We have also engaged with groups of athletes, sometimes spanning sport organisations, where they are able to facilitate a sharing of their current experiences,
and the recognition that they are not alone in their career challenges. Peers are undergoing
similar challenges, which contributes to a recognition that each athlete is still among peers,
just from a virtual distance.
The path forward
There is hidden inspiration in the words that athletes, coaching staff, and mental performance
consultants have expressed since COVID-19. We find ourselves working in a positive direction,
for the betterment of sport as part of life. Each author identified above plays a part in how performances are being played out. Performances on the field are most often the end product of
active work and inspirations in a series of opportune moments. The most profound net gain has
been the strengthening of existing relationships within the athletes’ lives, in their personal and
professional spheres. Mental performance consultants often affirm that these relationships
serve as the basis of client engagement, contributing to sporting excellence. The current
time is historical, perhaps in more ways than people have envisioned. We are curious of new
ways to further human potential. The answers might be atypical based on how we previously
went about our roles as mental performance consultants. Atypical approaches can be healthy
and contributive to excellence, founded in ingenuity. We predict that the best in
professional sport performance is yet to come, and much of that progress will be gleaned
from the current pandemic moment, assuming time, for athletes and providers alike, is used
wisely.

The COVID-19 pandemic may affect the world severely in terms of quality of life, political,
environmental, and economic sustainable development, and the global economy. Its
impact is attested to by the number of research studies on it. The main aim of this study
is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of sustainability (quality of
life), on sustainable development, and on the global economy. A computerized literature
search was performed, and journal articles from authentic sources were extracted,
including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald
Insight. The references in selected articles were screened to identify any relevant studies.
The following inclusion criteria were followed: research articles based on the COVID19 pandemic, and articles, research papers, journals, and news articles published
2010 to 2020. The exclusion criteria were as follow: psychology research, articles, and
journals published before 2010 and research articles having no link with the current
pandemic’s impact on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global
economy. Of the initial 350 articles identified, only 61 studies were found to be relevant
and meet the inclusion criteria. Based on these articles, the review highlights that
compared to developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as
African countries with compromised health structures have been greatly affected. There
are close associations between health, economic, environmental, and political issues
globally. The pandemic can be managed if we follow new policies that implement
economic and public health changes worldwide. A planned, coordinated approach
between the public-private sector is required, designed according to each country’s
health system and economy. We can come out of this crisis if we work together and
support both developed and developing nations.

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
INTRODUCTION
There is a high rate of uncertainty related to COVID-19, whose
pandemic impacts economic performance, sustainability criteria,
and development processes. Haider et al. (2020) mention the
effect of coronavirus on health and economic crises. Analysis
of its growth in countries, clearly shows that its development
leads to crises. Declining GDP rates damage health, education,
and industrial progress globally. According to Herbert (2020),
COVID-19 affects socio-economic circumstances because of
declining global GDP, declining capital flows, fewer investment
opportunities, and decreased trading. Not limited to economic
loss, this pandemic impacts social parameters like the changes
in sustainable psychological development. Globally, the rate
of poverty is increasing. The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) World Economic Update for June estimated considerable
fluctuation in the final ratios (IMF, 2020).
More than 20 million people currently live in extreme
poverty; however, Mukhtar (2020) reports that an increase of
about 420 million is projected to be living in extreme poverty.
Findings gathered by the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) reflect that COVID-19 has resulted in a
severe decline in human development for the first time since 1990
(Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020). Their examination reveals that the
current global picture lacks socio-economic development. These
issues and challenges directly affect an individual’s psychology
and assure them of a loss of psychological sustainability and the
addition of financial crises. Specifically, with many risks affecting
the public, cases of mental crises are increasing (Kang et al., 2019).
As a result of people being restricted to their homes and being
asked to maintain self-isolation, there is a high chance of someone
being severely affected psychologically, which is further impacted
by the lack of accurate guidelines or treatment.
When no resources are provided to manage people’s wellbeing, the situation, including pandemic prevention measures,
is reframed and affects psychological health. Concerning the
impact on sustainable psychology, Bai et al. (2020) discuss
the importance of improved mental health because it affects
individual growth and counters restricted personal activities.
The authorities’ actions and management criteria for regulating
the pandemic are beyond people’s control but adversely impact
their exercising, eating habits, gardening, dancing, meditation,
learning, and other activities. As a result, people perceive the
negative impact on their minds, and the sustainability of their
psychological health is damaged (Yao et al., 2020). In the view
of Li et al. (2020), COVID-19 impacts the quality of life and
mental health as it prejudices human living standards. The joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2020) notes
that this pandemic increases the numbers of people suffering
from stress and anxiety, conditions that are related to depression.
Thus, it is essential to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of
COVID-19 from the perspective of quality of life and economic,
psychological, and environmental perspectives.
Several research studies have highlighted the severe impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. It is worth noting that the 2013 SARS
outbreak experienced in Hong Kong damaged mental health
(Fernandes, 2020), but, specific to COVID-19, there are diverse
effects on mental health following the imposition of preventive
measures. Social distancing, self-isolation, limited meetings, and
lack of interaction directly decelerate the economy and mental
health. Many countries face declining projected global trade and
export volumes. In the view of Allcott et al. (2020), psychological
sustainability involves the merger of political perspectives,
human development, and economic aspects, and COVID-19 has
had an impact on all three. Fetzer et al. (2020) discuss the
pandemic’s impact on the global economy as self-isolation results
in loss of business revenue. Restrictions on consumers being
able to purchase ultimately result in an economic downturn.
Apart from this, stresses are being constantly imposed on
people worldwide that negatively affect their minds and decrease
economic activity (Iacus et al., 2020). COVID-19’s considerable
impact has emotionally traumatized individuals; the handling
of the situation has reduced their level of comfort, socially,
economically, and environmentally, according to Cartwright
et al. (2020). The amalgamation of these factors triggers a
high level of stress in people’s minds, which, meanwhile, affects
economic development, as it ruins efforts for developmental
projects (Pirouz et al., 2020).
We have faced several epidemics in the past. Asian nations
were impacted by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS
outbreak), and West Africa was under the attack by the Ebola
virus. They also influenced the socio-economic equilibrium,
affected public health, and caused numerous deaths similar to
what we are facing with COVID-19 (Marin, 2018; Lawanson and
Evans, 2019). The pandemic has affected all types of businesses.
There are shortages of medical equipment such as masks and
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), etc. It has made us realize
how fragile our systems are and that no country can face this crisis
on its own. A targeted and collaborative approach is required.
The main aim of this current research is to evaluate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sustainability of the
quality of life, i.e., how people are tending toward stress, anxiety,
depression, and other health/mental issues. Not limited to this
alone, the study discusses the pandemic’s impact on sustainable
development psychologically and economically. Given that
changes in psychological sustainability link with people’s living
style, and how they deal with their life situations, there is a
need to conduct a study in this direction. Currently, there are
reports and research articles that separately discuss the impact of
COVID-19’s rapid spread on the health system, mental health,
sustainability, and the global economy (Allcott et al., 2020;
Banerjee, 2020; Pirouz et al., 2020). Research related to the
pandemic’s simultaneous effects on the psychological, economic,
and environmental paradigms is required. That is why this
study explores information about and human experiences that
influence their quality of life psychologically, economically, and
environmentally.
Due to the pandemic, trade has also been largely affected. The
impact of this chaos will have a long-term effect on globalization.
All private and public sectors are under its influence (Donald,
2020). Previously, all large companies had goals focused only on
financial gain. However, now the level of interconnected trade
has lost its meaning. There has been an unequal distribution
of the benefits associated with globalization (Roome, 2011).

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
The more powerful governments and those who own major
conglomerations should realize that unless we work together, the
overall quality of life will be compromised globally. Working
culture and environment and the worker’s s policies should
be looked into to obtain a flexible, innovative, and empathetic
workplace for everyone to deal with this crisis.
Therefore, the aim of this research report is to:
• Analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
sustainability of quality of life
• Determine the effect of the COVID-19 on the economic,
social, and political factors relating to the sustainable
development environment
• Evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
global economy
• Examine the organizational changes and solutions for
dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and
• Highlight the effect of support of the world trade
environmental infrastructure in tackling the condition of
COVID-19.
METHODOLOGY
Study Design
All the guidelines and principles were followed while preparing
the methodology for this research. A thorough literature search
was conducted, and after proper evaluation and analysis, relevant
literature was identified and included for the present review.
To accomplish the desired objectives, all the studies related to
the topic published from Jan 2010 to June 2020 were selected. It
was assumed that including some publications of the previous
decade would be helpful in reflecting upon the practices and
strategies that were implemented in situations previously like
the global economic recession A computerized literature search
was performed and journal articles from authentic sources
were extracted, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar,
Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald Insight. The References
in the selected articles were screened to identify any relevant
studies. The literature search was performed by including the
following keywords: “Coronavirus” OR “pandemic” OR “SARSCoV-2” OR “COVID-19” OR “sustainability” OR “quality of
life” OR “Global economy” OR “psychology and Organizational
changes and COVID-19.”
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were: research articles based on the
COVID-19 pandemic and articles, research papers, journals,
and news articles published from 2010 to 2020; articles on
sustainability management related to virus pandemic. The
exclusion criteria were: psychology research, articles, and journals
published before 2010; research articles having no link with the
current pandemic’s impact on the psychology of sustainability,
quality of life, and the global economy and additionally, articles
that were in languages other than English. The process of
retrieving and screening the studies according to these criteria in
this systematic review is shown in Figure 1. After an initial search,
FIGURE 1 | Flow diagram illustrating the literature search and selection criteria
(according to PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis; Moher et al., 2009).
a total of 265 articles were identified in MEDLINE (PubMed), and
85 through other databases. After removing the duplicate records,
272 titles and abstracts were screened. Finally, only 61 studies
were found to be relevant and meet the inclusion criteria.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Psychology of Sustainability
According to Chandler (2020), the psychology of sustainability
and the criteria for relative development are associated with
socio-economic progress, leading to improved living standards.
The study by Srivastava et al. (2020) proposed that the
management of sustainability relates to ecology, equity, and
economy. Meanwhile, Cartwright et al. (2020) observed that
COVID-19 affects the quality of life as overall economic,
ecological, and equity conditions have changed. According to
Bastola et al. (2020), psychological and sustainability factors
contribute to well-being and allow psychological development.
Recycling, dismantling, and demolishing factors are affected by
sustainability. The psychology of sustainability also relates to
deconstruction, recoverability, and oxygenation (Iacus et al.,
2020). Using the micro-dimension of awareness creates an

opportunity to increase awareness that ultimately enables
involvement in self-centered development criteria.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on the
Psychology of Sustainability and Quality
of Life
Political, environmental, and economic aspects collectively
determine sustainable development psychologically (Bowen et al.,
2017). These aspects also determine how humans should spend
their current lives so that the same quality of life can be
transferred to and enjoyed by future generations. According to
Garfin et al. (2020), minimal changes in human life slowly alter
the future, but future generations will not perceive their lives as
the outcome of change; they will think that people before them
have led their lives in similar ways. World Wars and pandemics
have impacted our present lives. Moreover, the COVID-19
pandemic has dramatically impacted the political, environmental,
and economic aspects of human life on which psychological
development and sustainability are dependent. This ultimately
affects the quality of life by disturbing people’s living standards.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 has agitated social
problems and threatened the economies of the world (Nicola
et al., 2020). According to Arden and Chilcot (2020), growth and
development in different countries have stopped. The financial
stability of both developed and undeveloped countries has been
shattered as the pandemic has targeted many lives. Human beings
are highly dependent on socialization. Because social distancing
and lockdown are necessary precautions for avoiding COVID19, the resultant increased stress and depression directly lessens
the quality of life (Balasubramanian, 2020). Most people around
the globe are losing their jobs, i.e., their income. Profit margins
and revenue generated by various organizations have dropped.
To save the economy and their citizens’ psychological health
from the pandemic, many countries have developed strategies,
but years of struggle will be required to regain economic stability.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated crises
have traumatized people’s psychological well-being, especially
employees who have lost their jobs. The well-being of employees
working from home is compromised as the gap between their
professional and personal lives has reduced (Pratt and Frost,
2020). The situation has stressed employees and has led to an
uncomfortable and aggressive relationship with the organization,
which has directly, or indirectly ruined their psychological
sustainability on a macro level. According to Mahase (2020), the
world before and after this pandemic will never be the same as
people have isolated themselves, millions of lives have already
gone, and the global economy has slowed exponentially. COVID19 has imposed the harsh realities of unemployment, illness,
and bereavement on people, and long-lasting hardships and
struggles are required to mitigate the situation’s negative impact.
Coronavirus has substantially impacted people’s psychology and
has created an extensive psychological experiment on human
beings, which will eventually change the overall lifestyle of
current and future generations.
Knowing that the condition of the current pandemic has
diverse effects on psychological sustainability, disturbs the
quality of life, and restricts people to having to deal with
preventive measures. However, according to Di Fabio (2017), the
management of the psychology of sustainability helps to foster
well-being and enhance working conditions within society. There
are changes in behavior in which most people are suffering from
stress, anxiety, and fatigue (Wang et al., 2020). The full lockdown
restriction of staying in the home negatively impacts on human
living standards. Professional examination reveals that increasing
cases related to post-traumatic stress, nutritional deficiencies,
and psychological issues have been reported. Oher psychological
impacts of COVID-19 include a growing fear of leaving home.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on
Sustainable Development
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Economic
Conditions
The interdependency of overall prosperity and integrity of health
emphasizes human dependence on the state of the economy.
Econometric analysis of the world’s economic growth rate shows
that the current pandemic has led to widespread health crises
and economic damage. According to Haider et al. (2020), the
economic situation depends on the GDP rate helping to affect
economic recovery measures. Global economic crises due to
COVID-19 reveal economic decline. Moreover, the report by
Allcott et al. (2020) highlights the declining economy related
to fluctuations in GDP rates. In the current scenario, the GDP
rate has shrunk by approximately 4.2%, the first time for a
pandemic (Fetzer et al., 2020). Another report estimated that a
difference of 7% is projected in the coming period if the same
conditions continue (IMF Blog, 2020). Additionally, there will be
a considerable number of further crises if the IMF faces losses.
The overall rates of advanced economies like those of Europe
and America have declined the same as emerging economies
(Kang et al., 2019).
COVID-19 impacts global trade and investment. In
Fernandes’ view (2020), changing global trading volumes
can be observed, and all industries are eventually affected by
the pandemic. The World Trade Organization (WTO) supports
this view (WTO.org, 2020). Its graphs represent the changes in
the average value of trade, which includes a contribution by the
IMF to change the economic outlook, which, in turn, relates to
growing global poverty and declining living standards (Bastola
et al., 2020). GDP growth projections make it apparent that living
standards are heading to extreme poverty at an increased rate.
Subsequently, this negatively affects the economy, as it leads to
economic crises.
Chandler (2020) reports that COVID-19 has impacted labor
by 68% in just 2 weeks, which signifies the loss of many jobs
and directly increases stress levels. The highest unemployment
rates are in Asia, Europe, and America. In Asia and the Pacific
regions, unemployment rates have headed toward a decrease of
4.5%. In America, Europe, and Central Asia, it is 10.5%. Apart
from this, fluctuations in trading sectors have led to a decline
in manufacturing, textile, cosmetics, and many more industries.
According to Iacus et al. (2020), COVID-19 has enormously
impacted the income ratios in developed and developing

countries. A shift in fiscal policy packages has been assessed
across 162 countries. It was distributed as Austria (∼17.80% of
GDP), France (∼15.30% of GDP), Qatar (∼13.00% of GDP),
United States (∼10.50% of GDP), and Australia (∼9.70% of
GDP). Monetary stimulus packages across these 162 countries
were distributed as Bahrain (26% of GDP), China (14.14% of
GDP), Germany (12.49% of GDP), and the United Kingdom
9.09% of GDP; Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020).
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Environmental
Issues
Along with the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions,
there is an environmental impact, which Cartwright et al. (2020)
discuss. The COVID-19 situation impacts global emissions,
especially in relation to the release of emissions into the
atmosphere. The lessening of CO2 emissions relates to the
effect of COVID-19 on human development, which in the view
of Bastola et al. (2020), led to the 2020 financial crisis. The
restrictions on human development and declining rates of change
evolved along with the loss of environmental degradation. It
was observed that in Asian and European countries, the extent
of the ambient particulate matter has declined significantly
(Gautam and Trivedi, 2020; Kasha, 2020). Urban and industrial
areas have less carbon monoxide and aerosol in the present
situation (Gautam and Trivedi, 2020; Holthaus, 2020). These
environmental gains mirror the losses in the fields of health,
education, income, and trade (Bai et al., 2020).
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Political Issues
The coronavirus’s impact can be observed politically when
lockdown and self-isolation result in reduced export and import
rates. In the current situation, it is difficult to carry out activities
designed to run the economic wheel (Haider et al., 2020).
Furthermore, there has been a considerable shift in the policies
and strategies related to economic policies. On the industrial
level, there has been a decline in line with industrial restriction.
Even though support is being provided for business opportunities
to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still restrictions
on mobilizing current development. According to Bastola et al.
(2020), political parties have provided funds and highlighted
financial support to ensure people’s survival during COVID-19.
Moreover, the impact of lockdown, isolation, and rescheduling,
as well as the spread and fear of the virus, have resulted in new
political perceptions.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease on the
Global Economy
According to Moti and Ter Goon (2020), global economic
integration is required to deal with the implications of the
coronavirus pandemic. A balanced partnership between the
public-private sector, which takes into account the contextual
economy and health system, and is specific to each country’s
situation, will help national as well as international health
and economic recovery. The world’s total GDP depends on
the economies of separate countries; China’s economy is the
largest contributing economy, and the United States’s, the second
largest. Due to COVID-19, most factories are moving toward
closure and stopping the production of goods. This lack of
production of goods and services has a great impact on the
consumers, and no significant purchasing practices have been
recorded since the spread of COVID-19. In the same context,
declining sales are forcing the international market to face the
situation. Brands like Apple, Toyota, Jaguar, Land Rover, and
many more are facing the loss of investors and consumers
(Ahmad et al., 2020). According to Qiu et al. (2020), Hyundai
has shut down its business services and supply operations due
to a lack of consumer purchases. Starbucks has shut outlets as
consumers cannot purchase. A reduction in the import rate of
oil by China resulted in a decline in international oil prices.
Multiple uncertainties have been observed in the consumption
of smartphones as both demand and supplies are worsening.
The car production company, S&P, has faced declining purchases
(Ahmad et al., 2020). The aftermath of COVID-19 will thus
impact the global economy. According to an IMF report (IMF,
2020), the issues related to the current pandemic will restrict
the global economy. Overall sustainable development criteria are
expected to collapse. The distribution of economic policy globally
in response to COVID-19 was conducted across 166 countries.
It demonstrated that the United States is at the top, followed
by Sweden. There are few countries with no economic policy
such as Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Yemen, Liberia, and Denmark
(Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020).
Organizational Survival Envisioned by
Human Resources During the Pandemic
During the outbreak of the coronavirus, management styles
need to be changed to tackle operations and reduce the chances
of a crisis, according to Ågerfalk et al. (2020). This includes
consideration of online management, as online networks can
help organizations survive. In Donald’s view (2020), there are
two major types of organizational arrangements: traditional and
a new post-pandemic system. The traditional structure (prepandemic model) has existed during the past five or six decades.
However, its demerits were clearly evident during this pandemic.
It lacks clarity when defining roles and responsibilities. There
is a disparity in outcome attainment, and system workingconditions are less efficient. Although power allocation is part
of the matrix structure, in a crisis, it can lead to instability
and loss of control (Roome, 2011), resulting in an inadequate
organizational structure. The new-age model (post-pandemic)
focuses on the innovation, knowledge, and better required
skillsets (Guan and Huang, 2014). Organizations that are quickly
adaptive build creativity and possess a sharing attitude will be in a
better situation to manage its employees post-pandemic. The old
models based on power and control need to shift to a more open,
flexible, and modernized culture.
In the current situation, typical hierarchical organizations
will not result in better outcomes as the approach to allocate
power and authority to a specific group will restrict working
conditions. Human resources (HR) has envisioned a new model,
using distributed leadership, innovation, and continuous training
to adapt to the changing times (Hu, 2014) to obtain effective
results. According to McConnell’s (2020) study, organizations

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
with networked, hierarchical, distributed leadership styles,
cross-training practices, and flexible guidelines using survival
techniques to tackle COVID-19 conditions.
Support of World Trade Environmental
Infrastructure to Tackle COVID-19
The impact of COVID-19 is not limited to sustainable
development, as there are challenges associated with global trade
management. According to the United Nations Environment
Program (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP],
2020), trade is essential for saving livelihoods and increasing
economic cooperation. Whether it is related to COVID-19 or
typical situations, trade infrastructure boosts the confidence
level of operations and allows improvement of the transparency
of environmental trade infrastructure (Deshmukh and Haleem,
2020). Other than this, multiple actions and procedures
need to be followed for the management of the COVID-19
situation (Hishan et al., 2020). With support from world trade’s
environment infrastructure, there is an opportunity to supply
food and health products. This may help organizations to avoid
unnecessary export and import practices. Development in world
trade’s environmental infrastructure helps ensure public interest
and government support to effectively analyze the development
choices. Gilbert et al. (2020) confirm the importance of world
trade environmental infrastructure to boost the confidence level
and increase the transparency of economies. Deshmukh and
Haleem (2020) consider that the transparency of shared strong
data or collections of information contributes to supporting the
managed infrastructure required for COVID-19.
When West Africa suffered from a massive outbreak of the
Ebola virus, it led to a high death rate and affected the country at
numerous levels (Smith et al., 2019). Socio-economic disparity,
slow growth rates, shortage of food, and loss of businesses and
jobs resulted. We are facing a similar situation presently, which
demands that the health, economic, and environmental policies
should be modified so we can recover from this crisis and
collaborate in the future efficiently (Smith et al., 2019).
RESEARCH FINDINGS
The analysis helped to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on
the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global
economy. In the initial search, we found 350 articles, including 78
duplicate articles. After title and abstract screening, we were left
with 272 articles. Of these, 112 were assessed for eligibility, and
only 61 met the inclusion criteria. After extraction, the relevant
articles were categorized into the following subheadings to
provide a clear description: the author and year of the published
article; the assessment of the key findings due to COVID-19;
the present implications caused by the pandemic, and future
perspective that will help in the recovery from this crisis situation.
See Table 1. The focus of this work is to review the research work
published specifically in response to COVID-19. It is interesting
to observe that the majority of the studies were from 2019 to
2020. This is justified as the pandemic occurred in very recent
times. Hence the research mainly highlighted its current impact
globally and the lessons learned from current scenarios. Among
these, the majority are review articles, and only a few of them
were randomized and controlled clinical trials, which assessed the
economic, environmental, health, and sustainability impacts.
COVID-19 caused greater chaos than previous pandemics. It
is represented in all the studies: the global spread, its implications,
and how it has ruined all sectors, small and large. Even though the
assessment of various factors has been done in the studies, clear,
conclusive steps to be followed are not included in many of them.
The research has shown that developing countries are in a far
worse situation in managing their health systems and economy
than developed countries. Additionally, people of the rural areas,
the elderly, women, and children are undergoing major stresses
and life changes due to the pandemic. Even though air pollution
has decreased tremendously in all countries, post-pandemic there
will be piles of medical waste, which will impact the entire
environment. These research projects show that the management
and leadership systems based on power and control are not a
sustainable option in the future. Long use of a lack of creativity,
technological usage, and strict policies cannot be continued now.
Table 1 clearly shows that the pandemic has disrupted the
balance among all the nations. Though the impact is mainly
seen in the health sector and the economy, on a deeper level,
everything is affected. There is the struggle of SMEs, social
distancing norms, working from home, the new era of online
teaching, the suffering of daily-wage workers, a crisis situation
for the restaurants, hotels, and aviation department, changes in
fiscal and monetary policies, the psychological impact on health
professionals and health workers, and the extra workload on
the sanitation department. In terms of analyzing the research
findings of the included studies, it is very clear that the
impact of the pandemic has been assessed by one or more
of the factors (health, economy, environment, sustainability, or
management). However, it is clear that a conclusive result based
on the psychology of sustainability, overall well-being, and global
economic implications is lacking. Thus, this has contributed to
the goal of the present study: how can we learn from these
challenges faced by humans globally?
DISCUSSION
Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy
highlights that various elements affect economic conditions. The
study by Pirouz et al. (2020) observes that the current pandemic
hurts GDP as it directly weakens a region’s overall economy. This
is supported by the view that the loss of consumer consumption
affects the economy of regional economies, too (Fetzer et al.,
2020). In other words, multiple socio-economic factors lessen the
economic rate and decelerate the global economy.
The collected data also discusses the impact of COVID19 on psychological sustainability. The information gathered
revealed that humans experience an increasing rate of uncertainty
when stress, anxiety, and depression are continually increasing
(UNAIDS, 2020). According to Zandifar and Badrfam (2020),
there are various ways by which COVID-19 can affect sustainable
development psychologically. Evaluation of elements related to

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic TABLE 1 | Impact of COVID-19 and future perspective to improve health, economy, sustainability, and quality of life. Author/Year Assessment Implications Future perspective Moti and Ter Goon, 2020 Impact on the health and the economy As compared to the developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as African countries with a compromised health structure have been greatly affected. New policies should be implemented that focus on economic recovery as there has been inflation for essential goods and services. Government should strategically execute revised norms to combat the pandemic. It should implement a mitigation policy and a post-pandemic policy. The mitigation policy should target the nation’s health sector. It will include various new changes to deal with the pandemic such as defined containment measures, protection of health workers with additional benefits. Increased supply of the sanitizers and other Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). Regional opening of testing centers. Online education aimed at improving the awareness regarding the risks associated with COVID-19 and how to successfully manage them. The post-pandemic recovery policy will ensure that individual follow social distancing properly and also abide by the lockdown rules. For people to sustain they can be allowed to work for specific hours at offices, avoiding gatherings, etc. so that the businesses as well as the citizens are not at a loss. Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020 Assessed impact on the environment, health and economy. Air pollution has declined, however, the amount of medical waste has dramatically increased. Several fiscal measures, changes in the monetary policies and economy recovery have been shared by private sectors across numerous countries. Of 143 countries, United Kingdom ranks with the highest level of uncertainty in the assessment of pandemic uncertainty. Among 162 countries, United States has implemented the greatest policy cuts. Due to the crisis, many developing and developed countries will face recession as they have introduced several new policies such as fiscal, and monetary measures, and additional welfare costs with health policies. This has impacted developing and weaker nations badly. To deal with the economic slowdown, these countries will adapt to a scaled effect. Priority will be given to resource depletion over the sustainable utilization Governments across all the nations should aim to achieve an outcome ensuring that health, economy and sustainable development are not compromised once we recover from the pandemic. Berchin and de Andrade Guerra, 2020 Impact on sustainable development of all the sectors COVID-19 has led to an increased demand of healthier and organic food making the various food systems susceptible. The impact of the pandemic is largely observed among women, children, elderly, wage workers, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Several measures should be taken to achieve a balance among all sectors: Regional mobilization: Policies to ensure trade is continued and involves private firms to help small and medium enterprises. Global support to combat the risk associated with the cross-border transactions. Enhanced accessibility of technology: With the changing world and innovation occurring at a faster pace, technology should be provided in all the rural areas so people can access all kinds of information post-pandemic. Revised Policy: Policies to strengthen the overall system and not only focus solely on financial growth. Education: Encourage use of technologies and distance learning irrespective of the region or nationality. (Continued)

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic TABLE 1 | Continued Author/Year Assessment Implications Future perspective Donald, 2020 Impact on management and leaders; business and the decision models The design models of many organizations were based on the lack of creativity and flexibility, which were favorable 30 to 40 years ago. The importance of decision making, risk management, and involvement of stakeholders that worked previously needs modification in the present situation. New organizational structures are required, based on innovation, confidence, risk taking attitude, and flexibility. In the newly-designed organizations there should be no restricted roles, responsibilities, or structure. Training should be conducted so everyone is adaptive and can modify their needs as per requirements. Kottika et al., 2020 Impact on SMEs involving business and consumer markets There has been economic breakdown in the growth of United States GDP as it decreased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020. In European nations, GDP shrunk by 3.8% in the same period It is important to develop entrepreneurial personality traits as it is clearly shown that their attitude plays a significant role in the orientation of SMEs. A high quality of service should be provided to consumers following specific protocols that are open to change depending on the market situation. Etemad, 2020 Impact on the quality of life, economy, as well as the organization of various institutions. There has been a slowdown in the functioning of all sectors whether in a large or a small city, rural area or urban place. However, SMEs are the ones that have been impacted the most due to the pandemic. The situation prior to the crisis should be assessed closely, and processes followed regarding entrepreneurial and internationalization perspectives. A review and reevaluation of sectors should be done to maximize financial support to those who cannot recover on their own.
sustainability reveals that associations of social, environmental,
and economic factors lead to psychological sustainability
practices. The collected data reveals the impact of COVID-19
on the psychology of sustainability. The current situation has
a consistent impact on people’s mind-sets. As a result, there
is a need to adapt services to tackle mental health issues to
allow people to survive with an improved quality of life (Li
et al., 2020). With the declining economy, the contribution
of COVID-19 can be observed in the global emission system.
Labor can expect to decline in the future, and there is a high
chance of an individual facing job loss. This overall situation
leads to stress and restricts people in developing the economy
sustainably (Chandler, 2020). These employment issues are also
linked with psychological factors as they are the leading cause
of stress and depression, and ultimately hurt the quality of life
(Banerjee, 2020).
The collected data shows that HR departments are now
changing working criteria and focusing on alternative working
solutions for organizations. Allcott et al. (2020) observe that
COVID-19 forces HR to shift management from close-ended
to open-ended leadership styles. A dispersed workforce and its
interdependency on loose criteria are considered necessary for
organizational survival in the pandemic. Apart from this, HR
prefers to adopt flexible guidelines and cross-training practices
to provide practices and services to manage the pandemic’s
result. These sorts of instructions and guidelines help HR ensure
the survival of an organization and save corporations from the
calamities experienced by COVID-19 (Fernandes, 2020).
Similarly, most organizations are reacting in a managed
manner to increase their productive outcomes. It has been clear
that a declining projection rate is observed globally, and no
improvement for the projected rates is expected (Pratt and Frost,
2020). According to a report published by WHO (WTO.org,
2020), a loss of capital flows and a decline in annual charges is
decelerating economic conditions. Furthermore, there are also
considerable COVID-19 effects in the form of losses faced by
global trade and investment practices. Analysis of the impact of
COVID-19 on the economy reveals that the world’s economy is
expected to face further decreases in volumes and global trade
projections because the current situation is worsening day by day.
Along with this, there is an impact of COVID-19 politically,
which results in reduced exports and imports. Politically, a high
level of funds is required to support a country’s regulation
(Bowen et al., 2017). The spread of the virus endangers the
overall sustainability of development. The situation during
COVID-19 has been managed by the support of trade’s
environmental infrastructure as various macro-level elements
help to ensure sustainable development. With the help of
improved access to advanced technologies, it is anticipated
that production processes can make development more efficient
(Haider et al., 2020). There is a shortage in the supply of
drugs and medicine for mental health issues. This, according to
pharmacists, is a significant issue. It hinders the development
of health services and makes it difficult for practitioners to
improve their patients’ quality of life (UNAIDS, 2020). There
is an opportunity for support of world trade environmental
infrastructure as this allows corporations to work with advanced

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
infrastructures and increased interest levels. Moreover, world
trade support systems may enhance the efficient supply of
food and medicines. With this, there is a clear avoidance of
import and export practices without advanced infrastructures
(Herbert, 2020). With infrastructure support, there is a high
chance of transparency in the management of economies when
these companies support the developed infrastructure (Arden
and Chilcot, 2020). World trade environmental infrastructure
support includes a focus on planting trees and promoting
sustainable practices to provide useful opportunities to increase
healthy regional recovery.
The impact of COVID-19 on psychological sustainability can
be examined by observing the changes in people’s behavior.
Di Fabio (2017) shared the thoughts of people quitting the
workplace because of the pandemic, as this also affected
educational institutions. Along with this, a lack of healthcarerelated facilities contributed to the negative psychological impact
on sustainability. Balkhi et al. (2020) found that various
psychological factors affect people’s behavior, ultimately changing
global lifestyles. More than 80% of people worldwide show
more concern about safety as they prefer to reduce physical
contact with others (Wang et al., 2020). Around 23% of people
face extremely anxious conditions due to mental well-being
(UNAIDS, 2020). Other than this, the peoples’ behavioral changes
include increasing exhaustion and fatigue that directly restrict
them from working toward development.
There is a link between the psychology of sustainability,
sustainable development, and economic crises because all these
depend on the quality of life and related improvement (Rothan
and Byrareddy, 2020). Zenker and Kock (2020) mention that
the COVID-19 pandemic changes people’s lifestyles globally by
affecting their social, economic, and environmental contexts.
Multiple reasons drag the psychology of sustainability toward
losses in profit margins and revenue generated. Kang et al.
(2019) highlighted the crisis rate of COVID-19 by reflecting
on job crises, consumption rates by consumers, and increasing
unemployment rates. One COVID-19 impact on individual
well-being is that compromised work policies make it difficult
for employees to survive peacefully. In the same context,
multiple changes are observed in the situation experienced
globally as the condition of self-isolation makes people less
interested in harming the economy. Some of the destructive
realities associated with coronavirus disease include illness,
unemployment, bereavement, long-lasting hardship, and struggle
in handling the situation (Fetzer et al., 2020). Other than this,
there are diverse effects of COVID-19 economically, socially, and
environmentally. Rothan and Byrareddy (2020) used a survey to
explore the psychological impact of the ongoing pandemic and
found that people suffer from a lack of confidence and from
the infection itself. There is less concern about the maintenance
of health, as most people do not have access to infection
control measures. Along with this, there is no realization of the
situation’s gravity. People can only understand it in terms of
their situations.
Multiple uncertainties result from the outbreak of COVID-19,
as this affects the individual and humanity at large. COVID-19
has an impact on the psychology of sustainability, the nature
of thought, and the attitudes expressed. Within this context,
continual stresses are imposed on people from restrictions
that negatively affect their minds. Along with this, COVID19 stresses employees and others and creates an uncomfortable
relationship with a peaceful life, directly and indirectly affecting
psychological sustainability.
People’s psychologies have changed, as they are dependent on
the global situation, currently negatively affected by COVID-19.
The result is that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated crises
have traumatized people’s psychological well-being by disturbing
their social, economic, and environmental peace. The lack of
work policies leads to stress, as criteria for managing the situation
are, as yet, undeveloped. The data involving regional GDP
rates, economic efficiencies, sales rates, and trade rates reveal an
economic impact of COVID-19. All these aspects are directly and
indirectly associated with the pandemic. A fall of 7.2% in GDP
has been observed in economies.
However, we can learn from past crises to survive the present
global economic loss. In the Greek financial breakdown, 700,000
jobs were lost between 2008 and 2014 (KEPE, 2015). More
than 35% of medium-sized businesses were largely impacted as
compared to small businesses. Entrepreneurs managed to come
out of the crisis by providing us some key findings that can
help us to better deal with COVID-19. They ensured that their
products met all their consumers’ needs, lowered their prices
(Bourletidis and Triantafyllopoulos, 2014), utilized advanced
tools and technologies to provide something meaningful
(Giannacourou et al., 2015). Additionally, entrepreneurial or
managerial personality traits played a significant role in defining
company successes (Elenurm et al., 2014; Espíritu-Olmos and
Sastre-Castillo, 2015).
The various findings reveal that fluctuations regarding trading
system volumes when this relates to losses or improvements in
industries worldwide. They also reveal an increased proportion
of living standards worldwide is heading toward extreme poverty.
Crises are facing energy production as there are lower CO2
emissions, which mirrors the fact that human development
and progress are declining. Changes in management styles are
required to deal with how society operates and reduce the
chance of further crises. However, the adoption of a networked,
hierarchical, distributed leadership style, cross-training practices,
and flexible guidelines will benefit corporations in tackling
the COVID-19 crises. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 can
be tackled by the support of the world trade environmental
infrastructure, which is known to boost the confidence levels
of corporations in operations and improve the transparency
of global trade.
IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Humans have witnessed several previous crises in different
regions and countries, and humanity emerged from them. We
should think about creating a global change to prevent further
suffering caused by the COVID crisis. It is highly probable that a

El Keshky et al. Getting Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
recurrence of the present crisis will strike the global population
more severely. It is therefore desirable that:
1. Government be proactive and implement planned
precautions now before the situation worsens.
2. Management, institutions, and organizations develop
their skill sets demonstrate sustainability, resilience, and
innovation as COVID-19 has compromised traditional
business management and systems.
3. Globally, nations plan and sanction policies for the
collective good instead of their own self-interests.
4. All educational institutions provide necessary guidance
and professional help to deepen understanding of crisis
management. This will help individuals to become aware,
protect themselves, and avoid any risks or harm caused by
their negligence.
5. All the important health organizations, health
professionals, scientists, and researchers be provided
a targeted fund that provides sufficient training and
understanding regarding the pandemic’s impact on public
health, so the next crisis is dealt with more effectively.
6. Humanity take a collective approach to avoid unnecessary
harm to the environment. The earth can be saved if each
one of us becomes more responsible, provides support, and
care for one another.
We can learn a lot from this pandemic and become more
capable of dealing with any future crisis.
CONCLUSION
This pandemic has taught us that the entire world is connected.
If we do not work together and cooperate, humanity will suffer
drastically. We need to implement a few changes so that we not
only emerge from this crisis but are also able to continue with our
lives in a healthy and sustainable way. Firstly, it is important that
marketing processes are modified. Instead of blindly following
brands and getting attracted to the logos, etc., companies should
try to meet their customers’ requirements. There should be a
shift in business approaches from financial targets to what is best
for customers. Unnecessary use of plastic products should be
strictly prohibited. Secondly, any health-related issue should be
handled at a global level. If we limit ourselves to our own specific
race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, and background, humanity
will not be able to sustain this pandemic. A broader view and
understanding of public health need to be the key drivers for
all political parties. Thirdly, globally oriented with specific goals,
WHO should be the decision-maker for our health and wellbeing. Guaranteed budgets should be allocated, and policies
prioritizing health in different regions and cultures should be
planned. Fourthly, people from all cultures and interests, such
as health professionals, scientists, environmentalists, researchers,
politicians, sociologists, and ethicists should cooperate and work
to improve the current situation. Additionally, all the policies
related to the functioning of society, taxation, fiscal policy,
environmental issues, economy, and health should be changed so
humans can survive on planet Earth harmoniously.

NEW PAPER


Sport psychology services to high performance athletes
during COVID-19
These are trying times for us all. COVID-19 has altered our lives as citizens. The changes associated with the current pandemic have presented sport and exercise psychologists with many
challenges and opportunities related to sport performance, physical activity and health.
Here, we focus on what was, and is presently, being encountered by mental performance consultants in relation to the aspiring Olympic athletes they are supporting.
Within recent weeks, mental performance consultants working with Olympic aspirants have
evidenced a growing number of suggestions how aspiring athletes might proceed in their
sports and in their broader lives, based on their national conditions and regional responses
to the pandemic. Each national funding agency, Olympic committee, federal government,
and sport organisation, is rolling out strategies of how mental performance consultants can
work effectively with clients in what for many, but not all, is a socially distanced world.
Discussions have varied from the challenges that athletes are encountering to issues associated with social isolation, career disruption, qualification process uncertainty, and unconventional and limited access to effective training environments and training partners.
Underpinning these considerations is the health and wellbeing of athletes in their pursuits
toward excellence.
Historically, editorials within the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology were
paired with special issues, such as the one focused on international approaches to Olympic
athlete performance, published in 2016. Within the current editorial, however, there is a deviation in approach, caused by a global circumstance – sport is not being experienced as usual;
the challenges posed for those engaging in sport, region by region, are uncharted.
The focus we have set, in what should have been the 2020 Olympic year, is placed on the
shared challenges and the emergence of solutions that mental performance consultants are
presently undertaking in their work with athletes. The co-authors of this editorial are from
Asia, Europe, and North America. We have published on the topic of Olympic performance
and we are currently immersed in work with Olympic athletes in our respective countries.
What follows is a synthesised commentary.
The reader might posit that embedded in each author’s work, approaches are idiosyncratic
and driven partly by culture and context, which is a correct assumption. For example, some of
us are working from a distance, where others are consulting face-to-face. However, what we
share in common is astounding, despite our respective locations and circumstances. We
present this editorial, structured into three temporal stages: (a) before the 2020 Olympics
were postponed, (b) once the Olympics were postponed, and (c) the path being re-set
toward Tokyo, 2021.
Before Olympic postponement
Life tends to be normal before crisis transitions are experienced, within and outside of highperformance sport. Within high-performance sport, there were initial murmurings of a potential

https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2020.1754616virus in several countries, as the contributing authors helped prepare and accompany aspirants
to qualification events. Progressively, there were increasing numbers of people identified with
COVID-19; these heightening numbers were found across continents to the point where athletes experienced cancellations of Olympic qualification events. Initial postponements,
became indefinite postponements.
Athletes were puzzled, and near the centre of these discussions, their mental performance
consultants were seeking to support agile mindsets in their clients. Calendars were changing
and for some countries, centralised programmes began to experience positive cases of athletes
with COVID-19. Within some countries, programmes were temporarily closed. Within other
cases, the athletes were experiencing a much tighter world, comprised of their centralised
lives, though diminishing direct contact with the world outside their national sport centres.
What the athletes from these particular nations shared was a reality of being stifled and
apart from their local communities, including their cities, with limited physical access to
family members and friends. What became apparent for such athletes through social media
was that while they were distancing, competitors from some foreign countries were still able
to train in more normal formats, serving to advantage some and disadvantage others.
National sport organisations and Olympic committees then began to express concerns
regarding the scheduling of the Olympics. Within a fluid global environment, practitioners
were in contact with athletes, many of whom made plans, not only for the Olympics, but
also for after the Olympics. Some planned a continuation into the next Olympic cycle, especially
those in the earlier stages of their national team careers, where others planned to begin
families, return to universities or colleges, or enter into a professional career. Life plans were
in flux, and these extended beyond sport to a broader holistic existence. The stress responses
in the moment included decreased sleep, decreased appetite, increased rumination, loneliness,
and fear that present uncertainty could parlay into the loss of their Olympic moment,
altogether.
Underpinning our collective approaches were strategies that fostered openness in terms of
the concerns the athletes were thinking and feeling. Some of this work varied from in-person to
socially distanced consulting, though our approaches often converged. Openness was in part a
matter of encouraging athletes to express their challenges, fears, frustrations, and uncertainties, first to vent these, and then, to begin to prepare for problem solving as more information
emerged. Openness also meant encouraging a clear flow of communication among the athletes and those who worked with them in their sport organisations. Our belief was that
moments of challenge served to fortify relationships and unify each team’s membership. Openness was especially cathartic when discussions were constructive. This openness was encouraged beyond work with the mental performance consultants, onward to support seeking from
close friends and family members. Openness meant much more than sport focused discussions, onward to those about the basic human conditions, such as healthy living, eating, sleeping, and thinking in one’s general life.
Formal Olympic postponement
Within only a few weeks, Olympic committees were withdrawing from the Games. The domino
effect of these decisions on the part of nations then transitioned to the International Olympic
Committee and the host nation’s decision to cancel the existing date for the 2020 Olympics.
The athletes’ emotional responses varied from relief to questioning of whether a re-scheduled event would take place. Aspiring Olympic athletes are known for their fortitude and resilience. Their visions are set well in advance, whilst technical, tactical, physiological, and
psychological gaps are filled. The athletes then seek to be in their prime to compete on the
270 EDITORIALworld stage during their Olympic moment. However, suddenly, years of hard work, diligence,
and commitment were placed in question – one immediate unknown was whether there
would be a tangible Olympic Games or equivalent at the culmination of the Olympic quadrennia? Further questions followed. What about athletes who were already or nearly qualified for
2020 – would their qualifications remain valid into the future should a new date be calendared?
What should they do in the meantime, while the event was being re-scheduled? How could
they fill their days, typically consumed by training that was built around a time-based goal
of either qualification or Olympic engagement?
Not all responses were negative. Some athletes recognised gaps in their development
toward their Olympic birth or their potential Olympic performance. When athletes train at
high intensity, there is a particular time in a quadrennia, during the final year of the cycle
and associated qualification, where they and those who support them, commit to capitalising
on existing strengths and minimising existing limitations. Gaps always exist in every athlete’s
preparation, and many of the athletes began to reflect upon their current status and pondered
about their existing gaps. Several of us posed the question to these athletes “that if time were
allowed to slow down during the Olympic year, what would they focus on and seek to
enhance?”. These gaps were technical, tactical, analytical, psychological, or physiological.
Several of the athletes also had lingering injuries that compromised their ability to perform
at their best. Such has always been the nature of pushing one’s physical limits.
When the athletes began to compile a list of “gaps” in their current developmental status,
openings were created to explore opportunities not previously available to the athletes. These
opportunities necessitated creativity, as typical training access for some athletes was not
immediately available. For the athletes who remained centralised, more time became available
to delve into gaps and begin to explore these with their coaches, with support from mental
performance consultants. The shift for these athletes was from a feeling of being halted in
their progress, to a yet undefined period of time where constructive problem solving could
ensue. The athletes and those who worked with them could channel energy and strengthen
existing weaknesses, that could in turn, reinforce existing strengths when competition activities
resumed. Hence, if there were ever moments for interventions such as mindfulness, goalsetting, and re-framing, regardless whether these were from video and tele-consulting or inperson, that moment had arrived.
The scenarios focused on “gap searches” above exemplified effective responses to a trying
moment in time; one not all athletes would have capitalised on. Without constructive guidance
and support, athletes finding themselves unforeseeably inactive, or without direction, tend to
suffer from substantive psychological stress and potential mental ill health. What is known
about athletes during crisis transitions from both mental health and career transition scholarship, and in relation to the latter, particularly the injury and retirement scholarship, suggests
that lacking a career direction after years of immersing oneself in an intrinsic high-performance
goal, places athletes in peril. Some of these athletes have also been challenged by burnout syndrome. Personal feelings of alienation and poor coping responses, in this case, compounded by
social isolation, have resulted for some in compromised mental health. Never has there been a
more important moment for mental performance consultants to be accessible to their clients,
and to validate the multitude of mixed thoughts and emotions experienced by Olympic aspirants. Access needed to transcend availability; to the type of encouragement that could best
serve each high-performance athlete.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY 271Paths ahead to Tokyo 2021
As schedules begin to shift and readjust toward the recently scheduled Olympics, now in 2021,
there remains much uncertainty in terms of what Olympic pathways will look like by sport. Will
events become viable in the latter months of 2020, or will formal competitions and qualifications resume, early in 2021? Without a crystal ball, it has become nearly impossible to predict
intermediate steps of a now visible culmination to the current Olympic quadrennia.
There has never been a time when athletes and those who worked with them needed to be
more flexible and creative. The current pandemic offers opportunities that athletes and their
providers must find – they are right under our noses. Lessons gained through autonomy, ingenuity, resilience, life balance, mindfulness, and many more possible skillsets, can, and will, forge
modified, strengthened athletes and enhanced service provisions. Moments of quietness
present openings to reflect, re-evaluate, revise, and reform plans. These plans will undoubtedly
be roads less travelled, but highly valued. The pervasiveness of these life lessons can serve athletes extremely well, as lives are never linear; paths often are meandering, and even circuitous.
Retrospectively, we can all agree that even when one believes one is standing still due to uncertainties, one never is. The human condition is such that people learn from their circumstances,
and they do adapt. The days ahead will provide fascinating data, dialogues, and interventions,
built as a result of what could easily be dismissed as an isolated and unfortunate moment in
human, and also, Olympic history. However, one cannot underestimate the strength of the
human spirit. As for Olympians, they are, and will continue to be forged in (and through)
aversities.

ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning January 2020, has already had an unprecedented impact on 
children, families, and schools around the world and in the U.S. The context and impact has varied 
considerably over time, including tremendous variation in schools providing education services 
in-person, via remote/distance learning, and various hybrid configurations involving both 
in-person and remote/distance learning configurations. This special topic section of School 
Psychology Review aims to disseminate innovations and adaptations in research, training, and 
practice that help to inform and advance the field during the COVID-19 pandemic. This introductory 
article offers a brief acknowledgement of the pervasive impact on communities around the world, 
provides a succinct synthesis of several recent research developments focused on key issues 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and school psychology, as well as the pervasive impact on 
society, and then highlights the first three articles featured in this special topic section focused 
on adaptations and new directions for the field.
IMPACT STATEMENT
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on the education of children in communities 
around the world. Contemporary research highlights innovations and adaptations in research, 
training, and practice that help to inform and advance the field of school psychology during and 
following the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent scholarship provides important guidance related to 
important ethical, legal, safety, and technology considerations related to conducting psychoeducational 
assessments. Additionally, recommendations regarding consultation for parents to support young 
children facing challenges with inattention and hyperactivity are discussed.
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, described as a “oncein-a-century pandemic” (Gates, 2020), has disrupted 
essential aspects of public, economic, education, and private life around the globe (World Health Organization, 
2020a). Around the world (as of November, 2020) there 
were over 52 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 
1.2 million deaths associated with COVID-19 (World 
Health Organization, 2020b). In the U.S. (as of November, 
2020) there were over 10 million confirmed COVID-19 
cases and over 242,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a). The 
COVID-19 pandemic has already had an unprecedented 
impact on children, families, and schools around the 
world, including the U.S. (John Hopkins University, 2020; 
World Health Organization, 2020a). Presently, there are 
many unknowns regarding when the increasing number 
of cases will be reduced and the spread of COVID-19 will 
be controlled around the world (Scudellari, 2020).
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools in the 
U.S. have been closed for a period of time, while some 
schools continue to remain closed for in-person instruction (Education Week, 2020). A variety of strategies have 
emerged in an attempt to continue to educate and support 
children, including providing education services in-person, remote/distance learning, and various hybrid configurations involving both in-person and remote/distance 
strategies. As education professionals adapt to meet the 
education, social, and emotional needs of students, there 
are a range of services for students that continue to be 
disrupted (for example, food/nutrition, healthcare, extracurricular activities, family/community collaboration, and 
mental health services); thus, reducing the scope of student support services. Additional challenges for children 
during the COVID-19 pandemic include disruption in 
academic learning, social isolation, family financial concerns, greater childhood adverse experiences, trauma, 
grief, and increased screen time (Golberstein et al., 2020). 
Notably, the impact is even greater for students with disabilities (Brandenburg et al., 2020); students from minoritized communities including Black, Indigeneous, culturally

low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM); gender and sexual minoritized youth (Salerno et al., 2020); 
and students experiencing an intersection of oppressive 
systems (VanLancker & Parolin, 2020; Yip, 2020).
This special topic section of School Psychology Review
aims to disseminate innovations and adaptations in 
research, training, and practice that contribute to advancing the field of school psychology. Due to the continuing 
course of the COVID-19 pandemic, articles addressing 
this special topic will be published across several volumes 
to feature information throughout the course of the pandemic. Current research developments on key issues 
related to the pandemic and school psychology are discussed next (the pervasiveness of COVID-19’s impact on 
society requires a selective review). Finally, the three articles pertaining to COVID-19 and school psychology that 
are featured in this issue are briefly described.
RECOGNIZING THE DISPROPORTIONATE 
DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON MINORITIZED 
COMMUNITIES
While the COVID-19 virus indiscriminately affects all 
humans, it is known that individuals from racially and 
ethnically minoritized communities are at increased risk 
of contracting the virus and dying from it (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b; Yip, 2020). 
Compared to White persons, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are disproportionately higher among 
American Indian, Alaska Native, Black, and Latinx persons, while Asian persons have disparate numbers of cases 
and hospitalizations (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2020b). Excess death statistics collected from 
January 26th, 2020 to October 3rd, 2020 (compared with 
same week deaths in 2015-2019) show the tragic loss of 
life happening most markedly among Latinx persons, followed by American Indian, Alaska Native, Black and Asian 
persons (Rossen et al., 2020). Rossen and colleagues define 
excess deaths “as the number of persons who have died 
from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths 
for a given place and time” (p. 1522).
Factors identified that are increasing COVID-19 risk 
and loss of life are structural and systemic racism, discrimination, healthcare access and use, occupation, opportunity gaps (education, income, and wealth), and 
overcrowded housing (Webb, Napoles, & Perez-Stable, 
2020). Students from minoritized communities including 
Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ+) are prone to 
additional bias, trauma, and discriminatory treatment 
during COVID-19 beyond that which they already bear 
due to unjust societal inequities which cut across all 
systems, including employment, insurance, income and 
access to health care, including mental health treatment 
(Gaylord-Harden et al., 2020; Lopez et al., 2020; Poteat 
et al., 2020; Salerno et al., 2020; Tsethlikai et al., 2020; 
Wakabayashi et al., 2020; Yip, 2020). Fueled by racist and 
xenophobic language in the United States including misplaced blame for spreading COVID-19, Asian Americans 
are being unjustly scapegoated and targets of COVIDrelated racist discrimination (Gruber et al., 2020). Further, 
the COVID-19 related school closures may be particularly 
harmful to persons who identify as LGBTQ+, and who 
have intersected minoritized identities as racial ethnic 
minorities, because schools are frequently places where 
mental health services are provided for those experiencing 
homelessness and having an undocumented immigration 
status (Zhang et al., 2020, as cited in Salerno et al., 2020).
INTERLOCKING SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION & 
SYNDEMIC THEORY
The tragic reality of health disparities is not surprising 
considering the history of systemic oppression and inequities that have plagued the U.S. and have targeted these 
communities since its beginnings. Due to the important 
scholarship of Black females including Crenshaw (1989, 
1991) and the Combahee River Collective (1986) on intersectionality theory, we understand that these factors are 
part of inequitable conditions stemming from interlocking 
systems of oppression (Velez & Spencer, 2018). Indeed, 
these complex cultural ecological systems have interacted 
with COVID-19 and pre-existing health conditions to create a syndemic in the US that clusters around particular 
minoritized populations in complex and unjust ways
(Mendenhall, 2016, 2020; Singer et al., 2017).
While COVID-19 is a global pandemic, the disparate 
patterns documented in the U.S. are not global, they are 
localized to our country due to our unique cultural and 
socio-political context (Mendenhall, 2020). Many other 
countries have not experienced syndemic outcomes during 
the pandemic (Mendenhall, 2016, 2020; Wilson, 2020). 
The reason Mendenhall (2020) explains is because:
pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, 
respiratory disorders, systemic racism, mistrust in science and leadership, and a fragmented health-care system have driven the spread and interacted with the virus. 
These synergistic failures have caused more death and 
devastation than many other contexts. (p. 1)
PSYCHOSOCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH TOLL OF 
THE PANDEMIC
Recent research has pointed to the impact of the pandemic on children and adolescents’ psychological School-Based Mental Health and School Climate 433
functioning. Much of this research has focused on the 
impact of the lockdowns, school closure, and quarantine 
on adjustment, largely in countries who were the hardest 
hit early on, such as China, Italy, Spain, and India. For 
example, Jiao et al. (2020) reported on the results of a 
preliminary study conducted in China by the ChinaEPAUNEPSA working group to understand emotional 
distress among children aged 3 years to 18 years. Rates 
of fear and anxiety were found for youth residing in areas 
that had high rates of infection, while distress was mitigated by media entertainment, reading, and physical 
exercise. Duan et al. (2020) surveyed 359 children and 
3,254 adolescents in China and found that 22% were suffering from depressive symptoms. Further, greater 
depression symptoms were associated with emotion-focused coping, being female, and residing in urban areas, 
whereas less depressive symptoms were associated with 
problem-focused coping.
In a study of the impact of being quarantined in India, 
Saurabh and Ranjan (2020) found that among quarantined children and adolescents, worry (69%), helplessness (66%), and fear (62%) were the most common 
feelings experienced by quarantined youth. In Spain, 
86% of parents indicated changes in their children’s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine; including difficulty concentrating (77%), boredom (52%), 
irritability (39%), loneliness (31%), and worries (30%) 
(Orgilés et al., 2020). A study of Italian children found 
that one out of four children showed regressive symptoms, demanding physical proximity to parents during 
the night and over 50% showed increased agitation, 
intolerance of rules, and excessive demands (Pisano, 
Galimi, & Cerniglia, 2020). Sharma et al. (2020) identified risk and protective factors for adolescent and 
emerging adult mental health in Nepal, a country whose 
lockdown happened with little warning or preparation. 
Risk factors for mental health challenges included lack 
of mental health services, social media use, lack of 
understanding of lockdown restrictions, and sudden 
work and student life changes. Protective factors 
included cultural acceptance of facemasks, school space 
repurposing, and free counseling. School closures may 
lead to disruption in school based mental health services 
for students, resulting in an increase in mental health 
difficulties among children and adolescents.
There is also increased concern that abuse and violence rates may increase among children and adolescents 
as a result of being quarantined. Humphreys et al. (2020) 
argue that parental stress and anxiety about financial, 
logistical, and existential concerns may result in parents 
managing this anxiety by directing verbal and physical 
abuse toward their children. School closures also mean 
that there are fewer mandatory reporters interacting 
with potentially abused children; thus, this pandemic 
has the potential to lead to reduced detection of 
maltreatment.
RESEARCH, TRAINING, AND PRACTICE IN 
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
School psychology has had to adapt across all aspects of 
research, training, and practice. As we remain in the throes 
of consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, assessment, 
intervention, consultation and other forms of service 
delivery have begun to be adapted, and will likely look 
markedly different in the foreseeable future. One of the 
most monumental COVID-19 related changes has been 
the sudden shift to telepsychology following the closure 
of schools, clinics, and community mental health agencies 
across the United States and world (Callahan, 2020). 
Telepsychology, while relatively new to school psychology, 
has been a focus of research and clinical practice for many 
years (Abbott et al., 2008, as cited in Drum & Littleton, 
2014; APA, 2013; Hilty et al., 2003; Maheu et al., 2020). 
McCord et al. (2020) offer empirical research showing 
equivalent telepsychology behavioral and mental health 
outcomes compared with face-to-face services. McCord 
et al. (2020) specifically highlight two separate meta-analyses (Backhaus et al., 2012; Hilty et al., 2013) which lend 
support to telepsychology benefits. Backhaus et al. (2012) 
reported positive results for the efficacy, feasibility, and 
client satisfaction of video psychotherapy, based on 65 
studies. There were four studies in the meta-analysis that 
included children/adolescents and three incorporating 
family therapy. Only 23/42 reported race/ethnicity data 
and only three studies evaluated video psychotherapy with 
a sample that was mostly racial/minority clients. The Hilty 
et al. (2013) meta-analysis included “telepsychiatry” and 
“mental health” as keywords along with others, resulting 
in 35 studies evaluating telemental health published 
between 1996 and 2013. There were seven studies specific 
to children and adolescents, while six focused on populations that are culturally and linguistically diverse. Hilty 
and colleagues concluded that their meta-analysis showed 
that telemental health outcomes were equivalent to faceto-face services provided with different client populations 
and concerns, including children and adolescents, across 
multiple settings (i.e., home and emergency settings). Hilty 
and colleagues stressed the importance of providing treatment in the client’s primary language. They also stressed 
more rigorous study designs and research and policy questions centered on race, ethnicity, culture and language, 
along with other key considerations (i.e., geography, psychological diagnosis).434 School Psychology Review, 2020, Volume 49, No. 4 DOI: 10.1080/2372966X.2020.1852852
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY CONTEXTUAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
The existing literature reveals the efficacy of telepsychology 
in service provision (Backhaus et al., 2012; Hilty et al., 2013; 
McCord et al., 2020).The professional psychology field, in 
general, is rapidly advancing in developing measurable 
telepsychology competencies deemed necessary for ethical 
and legal telepsychology practice. In 2013, APA developed 
guidelines for telepsychology (APA, 2013). More recently, 
a professional competency framework has been put forth 
to guide telebehavioral health across multiple behavioral 
health specialties in addition to professional psychology 
referred to as the CTiBS TBH Framework (Maheu et al., 
2020). Relatedly, the Consolidated Model for Telepsychology 
Practice compiled from multiple state (Ohio Psychological 
Association), national (APA) and international (Australian 
Psychological Society, New Zealand Psychologists Board, 
Ontario Psychological Association) guidelines has been 
recently created (McCord et al., 2020). With these advances 
come a call to consider how telepsychology can apply to 
school psychology practice. McCord et al. (2020) argue that 
more understanding of telepsychology is needed with different developmental ages and in school settings. Given 
that most school psychologists work in schools, how telepsychology works with children and adolescents in schools 
is particularly germane. For example, school psychologists 
must contend with ethical, legal and practice issues that 
may be similar to those in related applied psychology fields 
and perhaps different, given that many school psychologists 
work in schools where there are provisions such as FERPA 
and federal laws driven by the United States DOE. Further, 
school psychologists spend substantive time doing assessment and using data to make special education eligibility 
determination that might be more difficult to transition to 
in a virtual environment compared to teletherapy (Wright 
et al., 2020). Testing and assessment conditions in an online 
environment may not be equivalent to standardization procedures, calling into question the utility of some findings 
(Farmer et al., in press; Wright et al., 2020), and highlighting the need for further research to inform the interpretation and use of these measures.
One of the most salient issues is that of maintaining 
client privacy when delivering remote services, such as 
concerns about who is in the room during sessions, security of electronic communications and handling patient 
records consistent with HIPAA regulations (McCord et al., 
2020). Due to COVID-19 being declared a national health 
emergency, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the 
Department of Health and Human Services (OCR, 2020) 
has relaxed HIPAA compliance guidelines for health care 
providers, including psychologists. Still issues of privacy 
and confidentiality remain, such as when services are 
being delivered in the child or adolescents home setting, 
where family members, siblings and others may be present.
Legal and ethical issues related to telepsychology services, such as practicing across state lines, having a protocol when there are concerns about suicide risk and 
ensuring that a comprehensive intake assessment can be 
conducted when there is not access to traditional paper 
and pencil tools are issues that have been raised over the 
years and remain today (Hilty et al., 2018).
School psychologists are ethically required to serve all 
children and adolescents and to take a social justice lens in 
doing so (NASP, 2020). The abrupt change to online learning illuminated the vast inequities in access to technology 
(Correia, 2020). Therefore, school psychologists must carefully consider and advocate for students to have equitable 
access to telepsychology resources and have adequate technology tools, such as computers, laptops, bandwidth and 
other forms of technology to access instruction. 
Unfortunately, as discussed previously, structural racism 
and other forms of interlocking oppression precludes equitable access for students and families who hold minoritized 
identities (e.g., Salerno et al., 2020; Webb et al., 2020). 
School psychologists must help to promote equity with 
respect to access to adequate mental health/social emotional support and proper diagnosis and assessment, which 
is not occurring presently and is influenced by long-standing racism, bias and related inequities (e.g., Combahee 
River Collective, 2015; Crenshaw, 1989; Sullivan et al., 2020).
SPECIAL TOPIC CONTRIBUTIONS
Despite the abrupt changes described above, school psychology is well-equipped to address the changing nature 
of research, training, and practice. This special topic aims 
to disseminate such innovations and adaptations in 
research, training, and practice that will inform and 
advance the field. Due to the nature of the pandemic, this 
special topic section will be published across several volumes to disseminate projects in various stages over the 
course of the pandemic. In this issue, three articles address 
various facets of assessment and mental health outcomes.
Two articles address assessment issues during the pandemic. First, Stifel et al. (2020), Assessment during the 
COVID-19 Pandemic: Ethical, Legal, and Safety Considerations 
Moving Forward, delineate important ethical, legal, and 
safety considerations when conducting assessments during 
the pandemic. The authors first elucidate the complex issues 
for school psychologists to consider when conducting assessments based on the extant literature (Farmer et al., in press), 
which includes the international literature. Next, they provide a recommended protocol for conducting assessments 
during the pandemic ethically, legally, and safely.School-Based Mental Health and School Climate 435
Next is a research brief by Aspiranti et al. (2020), 
Comparing Paper and Tablet Modalities of Math Assessment 
for Multiplication and Addition, examined technologyversus paper-based curriculum based measurement 
(CBM) modalities for math across two single-case multielement studies. The findings from this study suggest 
that CBM modalities cannot be used interchangeably and 
begin to document the disparities between paper- and 
tablet-based assessment tools. Notably, paper-based format benefited students from low-income and economically marginalized contexts, thus raising interesting 
considerations for future research and practice.
The third article, by Wendel et al. (2020), The 
Association Between Child ADHD Symptoms and Changes 
in Parental Involvement in Kindergarten Children’s 
Learning During COVID-19, examined changes to parent 
involvement and child behavior (e.g., ADHD symptoms) 
among four- and five-year-old children and their parents 
before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected prior to COVID-19 in December 2019/January 
2020 and again several months into remote learning in 
May/June of 2020. Results indicated that parents’ ratings 
of their children’s ADHD symptoms increased from prior 
to COVID-19 and during COVID-19. There were few 
changes to parents’ educational involvement. However, 
parents’ beliefs about their responsibility to be involved 
in their children’s learning changed and varied for boys 
and girls. These results suggest that COVID-19 may have 
a deleterious effect on children’s inattention and hyperactivity. While there are limitations to the study, the 
results do suggest that school psychologists can support 
parents by providing specific strategies to increase structure and to incorporate healthy routines (e.g., physical 
activity) into the day.
Overall, these three articles highlight important 
information for school psychologists to consider as we 
continue to adapt and adjust to meet the needs of children, staff, and families within the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Psychoeducational assessment 
should be conducted after the careful consideration of 
ethical, legal, and safety issues (Stifel et al., 2020). 
Similarly, math CBMs conducted with technology 
should not be assumed to be equivalent to paper-methods (Aspiranti et al., 2020). Children’s inattention and 
hyperactivity appears to be negatively affected during 
the pandemic suggesting that additional parent consultation is likely warranted (Wendel et al., 2020). While 
further scholarship is needed to address many topics 
related to COVID-19 and supporting the education, 
learning, adjustment, and well-being of students; these 
articles contribute to school psychology’s emerging dialogue on the COVID-19 global pandemic and national 
syndemic

Abstract
This study aims to identify the current psychological research status from the perspective of 
COVID-19; for so doing, we extracted the data from the Scopus database. In order to outline 
the trends in terms of the number of publications, bibliographic coupling, and coauthorships, we used the constructed intellectual structure of the research with the help of 
VoS Viewer of Software. Besides, based on our understating of the content of published 
literature, we also presented some suggestions for practitioners and future researchers.

INTRODUCTION 
Covid-19, originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has become one of the most 
significant health and economic challenges for governments all around the world. The world health 
organizations have confirmed that the global epidemic in January 2020, and to deterrent the spread 
of Covid-19, most countries have already announced a complete lockdown (Jiloha, 2020). Besides, 
the government, research institutes, and funding agencies are spending a huge some to find a cure 
for Covid-19. In connection to this, world health organization, in February 2020, assessed the 
existing level of research and information on COVID-19. Resultantly, the WHO issued a call to 
global research communities to prioritize the funding on Covid-19 that can help to cure this 
pandemic. World health organization in a meeting (Organization, 2020) held in its headquarter in 
February 2020 identified the following area of the focus for research.
1) "Mobilize study on the rapid evaluation of treatment for use at the Community level

2) Evaluate the available data immediately to find out what level of treatment strategies are 
most effective from China and elsewhere
3) Evaluate the impact of adjunctive and supportive therapies as fast as possible
4) Optimize the use of protective equipment and other interventions to avoid and manage 
infections in the healthcare and community environments
5) Review the current information to classify animal host(s), to avoid continued spillover and 
better understand the transmissibility of the virus in various contexts over time, disease 
frequency and who is more vulnerable to infection
6) Review all evidence available to identify animal host(s), to prevent continued spillover and 
to better understand the virus transmissibility in different contexts over time, the severity of 
disease and who is more susceptible to infection
7) Accelerate the evaluation of investigational therapeutics and vaccines by using “Master 
Protocols
8) Maintain a high degree of communication and interaction among funders so that critical 
research is implemented
9) Broadly and rapidly share virus materials, clinical samples, and data for immediate public 
health purposes". 
Our study aims at supporting the 8th research agenda regarding sharing the current and 
emerging trends in research on Covid-19. Numerous studies have been published on COVID-19 
covering different aspects such as medications, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry, 
Genetics, and Molecular Biology, Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmaceutics. However, very 
less is research about the psychological aspect and the consequences of Covid-19. On the early basis 
COVID-19 data, we conclude that it connects to psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions such 
as fatigue, stress, feeling of loneliness, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, 
(Mazza et al., 2020), post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, 
delirium. (Rogers et al., 2020). Therefore, this study aims to review and analyze the bibliometric 
data on the research related to the psychological aspect to support the WHO initiative to curb and 
cure the aftermath of this pandemic. 
Bibliometric is the quantitative study of investigating the trends and trajectories in scientific 
communication, we believe, our analysis of the research on COVID-19 can help the researchers to 
appreciate the existing research and prepare the future research design and directions.
First, the work presents a trend of publication and citation relating December 2019-May 
2020. Secondly, analyze the worldwide perception of the countries with the maximum number of 
articles and citations. Third, the top productive universities and institutes are enlisted. Fourth, the 
leading journals are identified. Fifth, the most prolific authors are identified based on the numeral 
publications and citations in terms of COVID-19 research. The study did bibliometric coupling and 
co-citation analysis to see how these journals, countries, and authors related to each other. Lastly, 
based on the reviews of the data obtained, we also suggest some future research agenda for COVID19 research from the perspective of psychology.
The critical participation of this research is that it offers a general idea of the famous 
countries, journals, most occurring keywords, and future research agendas for COVID-19 research 
from the perspective of psychology. This study can assist the editorial team of the journals to 
recognize the probable area of growth for future research..
METHOD 
Scopus database was used to search the research publications on Covid-19. Scopus Database 
is one of the most extensive peer-reviewed research repositories in the Social Sciences. The IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
37
repository is also accessed and acknowledged for empirical and quantitative research (Donthu et al., 
2020). The following criteria of research consist of these entitle: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, 
“severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, “2019-nCoV,” and “2019 new coronavirus, and 
searched for it in the “Title, abstract, keywords” option the search results showed 674 publications 
since December 2019. 
The bibliometric technique is used to evaluate the collected statistics. Bibliometric is a 
research field of library and information science (Bar-Ilan, 2008) that studies the bibliometric stuff 
with a quantitative method (Broadus, 1987). This technique is instrumental in classifying and 
analyzing the general trend of a specific issue, such as journal, research area, or a country (Bonilla 
et al., 2015; Martínez-López et al., 2018). In literature, bibliometric studies have been used to 
determine the significance of a subject (Laengle et al., 2017) the role of journals (Amiguet et al., 
2017) educational institutes (Martínez-López et al., 2018) and country (Bonilla et al., 2015). 
This work uses the VOS Viewer to map the bibliographical material graphically (Van Eck 
and Waltman, 2010). The VOS viewer takes the bibliographic data as input and converts it as output 
into the form graphs. The research uses other bibliometric methods, including the BC and co-citing 
of the author's keywords. BC (Kessler, 1963) happens when two documents discuss the same third 
document (i.e., Studies A and B, usually known as Studies C). Co-citation takes place when the 
same three texts cite two publications (studies A and B of the C study). 
Moreover, the concurrence of keywords analyses the keywords that appear more frequently 
in the same papers. The following prominent bibliographic studies (e.g., Donthu et al., 2020), this 
study uses BC for authors and institutions and co-citation for documents and journals. The cooccurrence of keywords is used to classify the keywords under general topics.
RESULTS 
The search in the Scopus database showed that there are a total of 674 documents related to 
COVID-19 and psychology. A brief content analysis of these articles revealed that most of the 
publications were focused on the impact of COVID-19 on psychological issues. However, very rare 
studies have discussed the suggestions or interventions to cope with this pandemic. Thus, in this 
study, we endeavor to address this issue while providing a holistic view of the psychological research 
till 26th July 2020.
Leading Countries in COVID-19 
Since the COVID-19 affected almost all of the countries in the world, thus, to cope up with 
this pandemic, several countries from around the globe contributed to spread awareness through 
publication of their research work. In the following table we categorized the countries with the 
greatest number of. These results might help the future researchers to see what the most productive 
and impactful countries in terms of psychological research in the perspective of COVID-19 are. 
Following table presents the results of the countries that have contributed more than 10 publications

It is of great interest to understand what the networking connection among the 
countries is publishing research on COVID-19. For so doing, we utilized VoS Viewer of 
Software and constructed the networking structure in terms of bibliometric coupling. 
Bibliographic coupling occurs when two documents cite a third study commonly. Regarding 
countries, bibliometric coupling occurs when a document from two different countries cite 
the third document in their publications. This shows how other countries use similar
literature in their publications.

Figure 1 represents bibliographic coupling among the countries based on five 
clusters represented with different colors (Green, red, blue, yellow, and purple). The US has 
strong bibliographic coupling. The bigger circle in size shows the stronger bibliographic 
coupling. The countries in green color clusters tend to have strong bibliographic coupling, 
and the same is the case with other color clusters.
While having bibliographic coupling on the country level, this question might loom 
around how are the authors from different countries networked in terms of co-authorship?

Top Journals 
One of the other important aspects of bibliographic coupling is to find out the 
journals that publish most frequently on Psychology research from the perspective of 
COVID-19. Following table 3 represented the journal that has published 10 or more than 10 
papers on COVID-19 in the first seven months, i.e., 26h

Theory Research Practice and Policy remains the most productive journal in terms of a 
number of 139 publications on COVID-19 and in the aspects of Psychology while the Irish 
Journal of Psychological Medicine remains the 2nd most productive with 32 publications. 
We can suggest from these facts that future researchers should consult these journals for 
their seminal work.

DISCUSSION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS 
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 has consequences for the patient, families, and 
society. The scientist and biologist are continuing their efforts to find the cure to this 
pandemic; the social and psychological aspects should also be not ignored. However, since 
most of the resources are devoted and occupied for biomedical research, hence; the current 
state of psychology research is not up to the mark. Our bibliometric analysis on the 
psychological research in the first seven months of this pandemic substantiated this claim. 
This bibliometric analysis showed that there are very few studies on the psychological 
consequences of COVID-19. In keeping this view, researchers should come forward to help 
formulate the interventions. Practical and theoretical research should be initiated to cope 
with the crisis and to strengthen the mental and psychological health. Psychological cries 
should be taken as public health emergencies. The cooperation between community health 
services and mental-health-care institutions should be decoupled. Some studies from the 
past on SARS have confirmed that individuals who have experienced public health 
emergencies still have varying degrees of stress disorders, even after the event is over, or 
they have been cured and discharged from hospital, indicating these individuals should not 
be ignored (Cheng et al., 2004). There is a dire need for systematic studies on the IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
43
interventions to cope up the psychological problems. Hence, here we present some 
suggestions for the practitioners and researchers to consider formulating psychological 
intervention or conducting psychological research.
The immediate support system should be established in the early weeks of the novel 
coronavirus. Awareness programs should be conducted through devices such as television, 
radio, mobile phone and internet resources. There should be audio, video highlighted 
message that attracts the attention of the community. Programs based on psycho-education 
of covid-19, disease course, precautionary measures, symptoms, and management. All 
programs telecast with the healthcare and mental health professionals' team, expert's 
interviews, or messages regarding disease course, the severity of clinical symptoms, place 
of treatment and other factors to classify individuals who need management. Interventions 
should be addressed to most venerable groups of communities such as children, elderly and 
immigrant workers. 
Universities and institutes should have some online courses and platforms to provide 
counseling services to the patients and their family members. The people with a suspected 
infection disease who are underneath isolation or at home, community psychological health 
services should give primary mental health concerned. Although, in any case, since of 
complicated work strategies, the heavy burden of workloads, and insufficient training in 
psychiatry or clinical psychology, community health services do not always know how to 
diminish the psychological distress of patients. A specialized team is comprising mental 
health services in dealing with emotional distress and other psychological disorders caused 
by epidemics and further public health emergencies. 
Our experience is that some of the COVID-19 survivors will be prone to bear 
negative behavioral and emotional responses such as grievance, bitterness, anger and fear 
that needed to be dealt in a sensitive way. For instance, tailor-made psychological screening, 
such as a personal inquiry and invitation for the need for psychological consultation rather 
than arbitrarily distributing the postal questionnaires, would be much appropriate and 
receptive for counseling. In addition, when facing a possible future outbreak, psychological 
preparation such as stress inoculation (Meichenbaum, 1993) may be needed to strengthen 
the sense of social support, reduce the associated social discrimination, facilitate the use of 
socially endorsed communication channels without reducing the amount of contact, 
brainstorm and share the possible coping, educate and adopt some realistic threat appraisal 
and booster the morale among the staff. 
Second, in the psychological assessment for the COVID-19 survivors, clinicians 
should include social support, negative appraisal (perceived impacts), positive appraisal 
(post-traumatic growth) and self-efficacy, which may be essential parameters for 
monitoring the ongoing psychological and perceived physical health of COVID-19 
survivors. 
Third, these significant psychosocial correlates may embed essential values in the 
clinical intervention for the COVID-19 survivors. For instance, given the significant role of 
negative appraisal in the outcomes, cognitive techniques such as comparing with the 
disadvantages and reappraising the disastrous fears might be appropriate when particular IJBPSY | Nawaz K., et al., 2020
44
maladaptive thinking or beliefs are elicited. Further, the clinicians should not only actively 
inquire about the impacts of COVID-19 but also elicit and educate various coping efforts 
that may booster the coping confidence and reinforce their perceived ability to cope with 
the impacts. Also, allowing the survivors to review or reiterate the personal gain and growth 
from the traumatic experience may create positive meaning, reframe the impacts and 
possibly alleviate their distress

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has imperatively shaken the behavior of the global
financial markets. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on the behavior of the
financial markets of Europe and the US. The results revealed that the returns of the
S&P 500 index have been greatly affected by a lockdown in the US owing to COVID-19.
However, the health crisis generated due to the novel coronavirus significantly decreased
the stock returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. The results also showed that the
economic crisis generated from the pandemic in Spain has had more impact on the
IBEX 35 as compared to the health crisis itself. On the other hand, in the long-run, Italy’s
stock markets are more affected by the health crisis as contrasted with the economic
crisis, while, in the short-run, both lockdown conditions and economic instability lower
the stock returns of FTSE MIB. The UK stock markets witnessed that in the short-run,
deficiency of health management systems imperatively damaged the stock returns of the
London Stock Exchange. The investigation revealed that deficiency of health systems
and lockdown conditions have imperatively damaged the structure of financial markets,
inferring that sustainable development of these nations is at risk due to COVID-19. The
study suggested that governments should allocate more of their budget to the health
sector to overcome a health crisis in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, countries affected by a pandemic or epidemic that have seen large loss of
life also see an impact within the economy and in their financial markets; a specific
example would be the spread of Ebola disease in 2013–2016, which caused a loss of 53
billion dollars in the US (Fernandes, 2020). However, the potential damages of the current
virus are still largely unknown. Significantly, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection disease
was first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 and spread rapidly to almost the
whole world within the next few months (Albulescu, 2020). Compared to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 is more contagious, which has been indicated by

a different fatality rate1
. COVID-19 has infected 1,865,413
individuals, and 110,008 deaths had been documented
throughout the globe until mid-April 2020 (Financial Times,
2020). In order to eradicate this pandemic, the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended maintaining social distance,
which generated the severe lockdown situation on the globe
(WHO, 2020). Accordingly, the economic circle in the whole
world has been disturbed. Notably, the sale of Online Travel
Agencies (OTAs), Airlines, and Hotels has unexpectedly declined
(World Economic Forum, 2020). Even oil prices have nosedived
due to the sudden outbreak of this pandemic (EIA, 2020). Due
to globalization, the current coronavirus outbreak will aggravate
the economic condition, which can pave the way toward financial
meltdown (Huang et al., 2020). This pandemic has caused a
severe psychological impact on the economy while agitating
service industries and financial markets.
Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has severely affected the
financial markets while declining the value of stock index up to
10% in 1 day (Daube, 2020). Surprisingly, news or specific events
can fluctuate stock values (Shehzad and Sohail, 2018). Figure 1
revealed the market value in the European, American, Chinese,
and Hong Kong markets from January 1, 2020–March 18, 2020.
The period is divided into three rounds for comparison purposes;
the first time-lagged is from January 1, 2020 to January 23, 2020,
the second time-lagged is from January 23 to March 6, and the
third time-lagged denoted the period of March 6, 2020 to March
18, 2020. The results showed that the market values of these
indices significantly declined in the third time-lagged as COVID19 approached its peak in western countries. Spain’s stock market
share value was decreased by 27.3% in the third time-lagged.
COVID-19 tremendously shrank Greece stock markets.
Moreover, Figure 2 illustrates the volatility index (VIX) from
January 2005–March 2020. It denotes that the world has faced
severe financial crises in 2007–2009. The stock markets collapsed,
and the economies went through enormous pressure. A similar
scenario has been built up during the global pandemic COVID19. The stock market variance is at its highest for the second time
after the Global Financial Crises (GFC).
In this regard, the novel coronavirus’s impact is also
detrimental, and pandemic behavior is unknown, so its effect
on the stock return can last longer. Relevant to this, the US
stock volatility has been agitated due to the enormous spread
of this pandemic resulting in severe economic crisis (Sharif
et al., 2020). In such circumstances, it is quite significant to
analyze coronavirus short-term and long-term impacts on the
advanced countries’ stock return. This investigation argued
that as the confirmed patients of novel coronavirus increase,
the lockdown conditions becomes stricter, which lead to a
significant economic crisis and shocked the economic stability
of one’s nations. Moreover, deaths that befell as a result of novel
coronavirus specified the deficiency of health facilities, which had
caused a substantial health crisis. Particularly, this examination
analyzed the effects of the economic and health crisis due to the
novel coronavirus on the behavior of financial markets of the

all around the globe.
United States (US), Germany, United Kingdom (UK), Italy, and
Spain for the period of February 10, 2020 to April 9, 2020.
This study elucidates the effects by executing a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed lagged (NARDL) model. This
investigation provides remarkable policies on how to handle
the impacts of COVID-19 on the financial market and
answers the momentous queries of the researchers, policymakers,
Government officials, and academicians, e.g., firstly, does
COVID-19 have a non-linear impact on financial markets’
behavior? Secondly, does the health crisis or economic instability
generated by COVID-19 have a more significant impact on the
S&P 500 index? Thirdly, does the Nasdaq Composite index or
S&P 500 index respond more critically to the COVID-19 crisis?
Fourthly, does the economic crisis generated by COVID-19 or
the health crisis have a more significant impact on stock returns?
Fifthly, how does this suspended circle of economy, due to
lockdown, begin again? According to the author’s best knowledge,
this is the first study that examines the asymmetrical impact
of COVID-19 on the psychology of stock markets of mostly
infected nations of the world. Firstly, this project ascertained
the stationary level of study variables and discovered that all the
variables are stationary at I(0) and I(1), and no one is stationary
at I(2). Hence, a Non-linear version of the Autoregressive
Distributed Lag (ARDL) model can be applied.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
Data
This study utilized the daily data of the number of confirmed
patients and deaths due to COVID-19 and stock markets of
the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK, from the period of
February 10, 2020–April 9, 2020. This study has taken the data
from the database of Yahoo Finance and the European Center
for Disease Control and Prevention. Further, this investigation
analyzed the daily returns of IBEX 35, FTSE MIB, DAX 30, and
London Stock Exchange (LSE) for the nomination of Spain, Italy,
Germany, and the UK. However, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite
Index represents the US.
Methodology
This investigation utilized each stock market’s daily returns as
the dependent variable and confirmed cases and deaths as the
independent variable. The daily returns used in this study are
computed as follows (Syllignakis and Kouretas, 2011; Shehzad
and Sohail, 2018),
Rti = (ln(CSti/CSt−1i))∗
100 (1)
here Rti, CSt
, and CSt−1 denote the return value at time t, closing
price at time t, and previous day closing price at time t, for a
stock market i, respectively. The linear association between these
variables can be defined as;
1SPRt = β0 + β1USCt + β2USDt + εt (2)
1NSRt = β0 + β1USCt + β2USDt + εt (3)

where 1 signifies the first difference and β0β1β2 are the
independent parameters. However, NSR, SPR, IBER, FTMR,
DAXR, and LSER defines the return values of the Nasdaq
Composite index, S&P 500, IBEX 35, FTSE MIB, DAX 30,
and London Stock Exchange, respectively. Moreover, USC, SPC,
ITLC, GERC, and UKC indicate the confirmed cases of COVID19 in the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK, respectively.
Further, USD, SPD, ITLD, GERD, and UKD refer to confirmed
deaths due to COVID-19 in the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, and
the UK, respectively.
To ascertain the short- and long-run asymmetries, this
study employed the Non-Linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag
(NARDL) model introduced by Shin et al. (2014). This model
performs best with a small number of observations and can be
applied on a mixed level of stationary data, i.e., I (0) and I(1). It
evaluates the non-linearity and cointegration between variables
in one equation; and shared the short-run variations to long-run
asymmetries after taking the long-run parameters into account
(Shin et al., 2014). The NARDL model is the extended form of
the ARDL (Pesaran et al., 2001) model; hence, the full form of
NARDL model for each stock market can be specified as,

cointegration among variables is examined through the bound
test approach of Pesaran et al. (2001). This method relies on Ftest to evaluate the null hypothesis, H0: γ1 = γ2a = +γ3a = 0.
For this purpose, Pesaran et al. (2001) has defined two bounds,
i.e., upper and lower bound. If the estimated F-statistics are the
higher than upper bound limit then the null hypothesis of no
cointegration is rejected. However, if the projected value of Ftest is lower than lower bound limit then null hypothesis cannot
be rejected; besides, if the value of F-test remains between both
limits then the results are not conclusive. At the end, this project
employed the Wald test to verify the asymmetric long-run, γ

STUDY FINDINGS
The descriptive summary showed, in Table 1, during the COVID19 era, the mean of stock returns is negative. Further, skewness
values of these markets are also negative except LSER with
high kurtosis, which predicts high chances of loss these days.
Table 2 presents the results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and Phillip Perron (PP) test
(Phillips and Perron, 1988). It showed that the study variables
have diverse stationary levels, i.e., I (0) and I (1), and no variable
is cointegrated at I (2).
Bound Test Cointegration Fallouts
The outcomes of the Bound test displayed in Table 3 disclosed
significant statistical evidence of a long-term association between
study variables for each equation. The F-statistics for joint
significance of lagged level parameters are stated as 63.02, 39.11,
5.4, 5.1, 38.2, and 14.03 for Eqs 1–6, respectively. These values
surpass the upper bound limits of Shin et al. (2014), implying
that long-run cointegration exists among economic crisis, health
crisis, and financial markets of each equation.
Long- and Short-Run Asymmetric
Cointegration Reckoning
Table 4 exhibited the upshots of the Wald-test. The statistics
particularized that USC and USD have a non-linear association
with SPR. However, USC revealed short-run asymmetric
affiliation with NSR. Besides, SPD caused an asymmetric
influence on IBER for both long-term and short-term periods,
while SPC possessed short-run asymmetry only. Additionally, the

results of FTMR designated that ITLD has a long-run asymmetric
relationship with it. The Wald-statistics of GERC enlightened
that it has both long and short-run non-linear impacts on DAXR,
but GERD has a short-term non-linear affiliation with DAXR.
Moreover, UKC denotes a long-run asymmetric liaison with
LSER. Hence, the existence of non-linearity in the study variables
led us to choose the NARDL model for computing long-and
short-run factors.
Modeling NARDL Parameters
The non-linear fallouts of SPR, presented in Table 5, illustrated
that expansion and contraction in USC brings a reduction and
increase in SPR, respectively. It indicates that strict lockdown
substantially decreases the market returns of the S&P 500 and
vice versa. Further, a positive shock in USD caused a significant
rise in SPR. In the short-run, lagged values specified that a
negative shock in USC amplified SPR. Besides, all the lagged
terms described that an uptick effect in USD improved the SPR.
Also, a negative shock in USD and its second lag augmented the
SPR, but the first and third lag represents the reverse impact.
Furthermore, the negative and significant value of ECTt−1 stated
that disequilibrium occurred in SPR today due to COVID-19
will adjust with the speed of 1.3 units on a subsequent day.
The R-squared value indicated that the 91% volatility in SPR is
owing to COVID-19.
The NSR model results exhibited in Table 6, particularized
that both positive and negative shocks in USC escalate the
NSR, while enlargement (reduction) in USD instigate decrease
(increase) in NSR. It specifies that an upsurge in the health crisis
in the US expressively distressed the Nasdaq Composite Index
and vice versa. Nonetheless, in the short-run, a negative shock
in USD and USC demonstrated an imperative decrease in NSR,
whereas an expansion in USC lessens the NSR. The negative
and significant ECTt−1 parameter stated that financial instability
generated due to COVID-19 would be settled with a speed of 1.5
units on the next day. The R-square value signified that 81% of
instability occurring in NSR is the result of COVID-19.
The finding parameters of the IBER model (Table 7) identified
that an assertive shock in SPD has an encouraging effect on IBER.
Besides, adverse shocks remain insignificant. On the other hand,
an escalation (decline) in SPC has a negative (positive) influence
on IBER, implying that strict lockdown considerably caused the
financial crisis in Spain for the long term period. In the short term
period, an intensification in SPC, SPD, and a decline in SPC, SPD
increased the IBER. The negative and significant value of ECTt−1
elucidated that today’s disequilibrium in IBER will adjust on the
next day with a speed of 0.82 units. The coefficient of R-square
stated that 72% of variations in IBER are owing to COVID-19.

that rise (reduction) in ITLD diminished (amplified) the FTMR,
inferring that heath crisis imperatively contributes to Italy’s
financial instability for the long term period. In addition, growth
in ITLC enlarged the FTMR imperatively. The sort-run condition
in Italy denoted that first, second, and third lag values of FTMR
harmed its own returns. Also, growth in ITLC has a negative
impression on FTMR. Nonetheless, a negative shock in the
second lag value of ITLC indicated an encouraging effect on
FTMR. The consequences of ITLD symbolized that proliferation
in ITLD possess negative sway on FTMER, but the first and
second lag value have definite sway on it. Furthermore, a decline
in ITLD has a direct influence on FTMR. The negative and
significant figure of ECTt−1 itemized that FTMR will readjust
the equilibrium with a speed of 0.95 units each day. The Rsquared parameter denoted that 85% uncertainty generated in
FTMR caused by COVID-19.

lag, second lag, and third lag values point out positive
linkage with DAXR. These effects are because of instability
generated due to COVID-19. The R-squared coefficient
diagnosed that the 94.5% instability in DAXR is because
of COVID-19.
Table 10 represents the results of the London Stock
exchange. The concluding coefficients of the UK explored that
augmentation in UKD improved the LSER, while diminution
in UKD reduces the LSER in the long term period, although
the growth of UKC brought a significant decrease in LSER.
The short term period outlined that positive shocks in UKC
reduced the LSER, but the first lag value of positive shock
in UKD showed an alternate impression. Additionally, an
upturn in UKD possesses a diminishing impact on LSER.
These outcomes designated that lockdown and health crises
generated due to COVID-19 negatively impact the financial
markets of the UK for the short term period. The value of
ECTt-1 showed that fluxes occurred today in LSER will get
equilibrium with the speed of 1.1 units on the next day.
The R-square value reported a 65% variation in LSER due
to COVID-19. Figure 3 depicts the adjustment of asymmetric
effect in the existing long-run equilibrium, once moved to a
new long-run equilibrium as a result of positive and adverse
shocks. The asymmetric plots denote the alliance of dynamic
multipliers owing to positive and adverse shocks in S&P 500,
DAX 30, FTSE MIB, Nasdaq Composite index, IBEX 35, and LSE
markets. The outcomes revealed that these markets tremendously
respond to the positive and negative shocks befallen due
to COVID-19.
Diagnostic Parameters Evaluation
The examination employed the Breusch and Pagan (2006) test
to diagnose the Serial Correlation and Heteroskedasticity in
each model’s residuals, Ramsey RESET technique, to ascertain
functional misspecification, CUSUM, and CUSUMSQ (Ploberger
and Kramer, 2006) test to define the reliability of parameters.
The conclusions of these tests given in Table 11, nominated
that there was no serial correlation and Heteroskedasticity in
the residuals of each model. Besides, the plots of CUSUM and
CUSUMSQ presented in Figure 4 remain within the 5% critical
boundaries, inferring that coefficients of the NARDL model
are stable.
CONCLUSION
COVID-19 has imperatively shaken the economic indicators,
primarily the financial markets of the globe. The number of
patients and deaths as a result of COVID-19 are increasing
day by day, and economic conditions have become entirely
uncertain. Moreover, the financial markets of the world fronted
a sudden crash in their market values. This investigation
utilized the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL)
approach to estimate the non-linear impact of economic crisis

health crisis that resulted in Spain. In the long-run, Italy’s
stock markets are more affected by the health crisis than the
economic crisis, while, in the short-run, economic uncertainty
also lowered the stock returns of FTSE MIB. Nevertheless, the
health crisis in Germany pointing to a significant upsurge in
the economic crisis intimated an unimportant impression on the
FTSE 100 index. The stock markets of the UK recorded that,
in the short-run, an upsurge in the health crisis imperatively
damages the stock returns of the LSE index, but in the
long run, this influence was left to reverse. Therefore, this
research authenticated that the health crisis begun with COVID19 has devised another global financial crisis, and almost
every nation is fighting with these crises today. Moreover,
the study disclosed that economic uncertainty generated by
COVID-19 is highest in the German stock markets, while
the S&P 500 index is on the second-ranking, and Italian
stock markets are on the third-ranking. The study concluded
that the health crisis and economic crisis ominously affected
the stock markets of the globe. Consequently, a significant
amount should be allocated in the budget to explore and
prevent these pandemics in the future. Further, a complete
lockdown strategy does not prove to be an excellent remedy
as it harms the financial markets, so other strategies should be
developed, i.e., smart/partial lockdown. These suggestions are
essential for policymakers, Government officials, researchers, and
the general public.

Objective: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatened not only people’s physical
health but also every aspect of their psychological well-being: from their struggle to
avoid contracting the disease, to their coping with the disruption of the normal course
of their lives, to the trauma they endured when the virus took the lives of those they
loved. The objective of this article is to consider the group-level processes that sustain
people’s physical and psychological well-being during COVID-19. Method: Applying
group dynamic and group therapy theory and research, we explore why COVID-19
spread so rapidly. We also explore how people cope with prolonged social isolation,
distress, and social inequities, as well as how people deal with the psychological trauma
of the disease, which includes heightened levels of depression, anxiety, substance
abuse, and complicated bereavement. Results: Researchers and theorists suggest that
human beings are fundamentally social, and the need to gather with others is extremely
important, especially during times of distress. The need to belong as well as the
importance of reducing loneliness during uncertain times often encourages people to
connect, despite recommendations to remain socially distant. Conclusions: Group
treatment options developed by group psychotherapists are effective at reducing depression, anxiety, complicated grief, and stress. We conclude by examining the growing impact of online groups and the many ways that these groups help people improve
their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.
Highlights and Implications
• Group dynamic theorists and researchers provide important contributions to the
understanding of the prevention of COVID-19. Group dynamics explain why
some people perceive less of a threat and why some people refuse to wear face
masks or social distance.
• Group psychotherapy researchers and practitioners describe the importance of
group leadership, group cohesion, and the effects of loneliness and social
isolation on people coping with COVID-19.

122• Given the mental and physical health challenges we face with COVID-19, online
group and group therapy interventions are becoming more prevalent. The
importance of future studies examining the effectiveness of online groups (both
support and therapy) are necessary. We also need studies that examine what
individual difference variables influence the effectiveness of online group interventions, such as age, race, class, ethnicity, culture, attachment style, and level
of isolation.
• One of the main implications of this article is that it is critical to examine the
group-level factors that influence how we navigate a pandemic. Groups influence how we prevent the transmission of COVID-19, how we sustain ourselves
during periods of social isolation, and how we address the effects of complicated
bereavement, trauma, illness, social inequities, unemployment, anxiety, and
depression.
Keywords: group therapy, COVID-19, pandemic, group dynamics
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe respiratory
syndrome coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic.
A devastating disease, the virus caused respiratory collapse, inflammation, and organ failure,
resulting in the death of over half a million
people in the first 6 months of the pandemic.
With no known cure or vaccine available, the
threat seemed dire but also unavoidable. People’s lives were substantially disrupted as everyday interactions were replaced by prolonged
periods of isolation and loneliness. Most social
activities, such as school and work, were suspended, as were many sources of general life
satisfaction and happiness, such as leisure and
recreational activities. As the disease intensified, researchers documented elevated levels of
depression and anxiety, increases in intrusive
thoughts and sleep disturbances, substantial and
negative changes in feelings and emotional responsiveness, and substance abuse (e.g., Wang
et al., 2020). It is difficult to identify any aspect
of people’s psychological experiences that was
not significantly influenced by the disease.
Understanding and responding effectively to
the psychological impact of the pandemic requires recognizing and intervening to undo the
chaos it wrought on individuals’ adjustment, but
here we focus on the group-level processes pertaining to the prevention, maintenance, and restoration (after loss) of psychological well-being
before, during, and after the pandemic. The
pandemic attacked not just individuals but also
their relationships and the groups that sustain
those relationships, including their families,
work groups, and friendship circles. To cope,
social isolation was mandated, but that mandate
separated people from the groups that sustain
them. As sheltering in place wore on, the isolation strained the resources of people’s remaining alliances, including their families and closest friendships. The illness was also, in many
cases, a fatal one and so permanently changed
the nature and structure of many people’s
groups and relationships. Specifically, we draw
on the psychology of groups and their dynamics
to (a) explain how people reacted to the threat of
the virus (e.g., coping with health threats, increasing compliance with health mandates); (b)
suggest ways to counter the negative psychological side effects people may experience during the pandemic (e.g., dealing with social isolation, reducing stress in quarantined groups);
and (c) help individuals deal with the psychological consequences of the pandemic experience, including the loss of friends and loved
ones to the disease (e.g., coping with grief).
This focus on group-level processes does not
assume individual-level processes need not be
considered but instead only seeks to redress the
tendency to stress individual approaches rather
than interpersonal ones. All too often, analyses
focus on individual prevention strategies such
as wearing a mask, individual factors that influence health risks such as age, and individual
interventions to cope with distress such as oneon-one counseling. The current analysis, in contrast, serves as a reminder that people are substantially influenced by group interactions and
of how extremely important groups can be when

Psychological Association’s Commission for
the Recognition of Specialties and Proficiencies
in Professional Psychology recognized group
therapy as a specialty. This recognition emphasized the importance of group dynamics and the
benefits of group interventions that are critical
to mental health and relevant to coping with
COVID-19. Although there may not be research
that has studied the group factors directly related to prevention or intervention and COVID19, we can apply the knowledge we have from
years of group theory and research to this pandemic. Group theory, research, and practice has
important implications for how we try to control
the spread of COVID-19, facilitate coping with
the virus, and intervene when the public struggles with job loss, mental illness, health disparities, and complicated grief.
Prevention: Minimizing the Risk of
Contracting COVID-19
COVID-19, a highly communicable disease,
has spread worldwide. Authorities, recognizing
the magnitude of the threat, warned citizens of
the infection and proposed a series of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to limit contagion (e.g., stock sufficient food and water, secure medical supplies, and avoid travel to
destinations where the virus was emerging).
These NPIs were crucially important for controlling the spread of the disease, and the number of cases was lower in places where people
prepared diligently (e.g., Brauner et al., 2020).
However, many people failed to accurately assess the magnitude of the threat and heed repeated reminders to minimize that threat. Although studies of how people prepare for
impending crises have identified a number of
psychological processes that can work to interfere with proactive responses, including unrealistic optimism, diminished self-efficacy, and
avoidance of information pertaining to the
threat (Shepperd, Klein, Waters, & Weinstein,
2013; Stewart, 2015; Sweeny, Melnyk, Miller,
& Shepperd, 2010), these psychological processes were amplified by group-level processes
that caused individuals to misjudge the magnitude of the threat and join together with others
when they should have practiced social distancing.
Reassurance or Accuracy
People encountering a threat usually respond
to minimize that threat, particularly if they believe the threat to be highly probable and the
outcome to be severely negative and if the steps
to take to reduce the threat are considered efficacious (e.g., Floyd, Prentice-Dunn, & Rogers,
2000). Their estimates of likelihood, severity,
and response efficacy are determined by the
objective, factual claims of authorities—such as
warnings from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC)—but also by the actions
and reactions of those around them. For example, even though the CDC may warn that
COVID-19 poses a great risk to health, individuals may reject that information if it is inconsistent with the estimates of those they associate
with on a regular basis (e.g., family members,
coworkers, social network connections). Studies of social comparison processes suggest individuals strive for accuracy but that they also
show a preference for reassuring, comforting
information. In the case of COVID-19, associating with people who suggested that the virus
was only as threatening as the flu or even a hoax
resulted in an incautious response to the virus
(e.g., Erceg, Ružojcˇic´, & Galic, 2020).
Individuals’ miscalibrated estimates of threat
potential could have been adjusted as they discussed their estimates with other people, but
error checking is often overlooked as groups
share information. Groups can manifest rationality as they pool information to reach the best
decision possible (e.g., Larson, 2010), but too
often people overshare ideas that are common
within the group. If many individuals in the
group are aware of some fact, datum, or case,
the group will spend an inordinate amount of
time discussing those inputs and fail to consider
ideas and information held by only a few individuals in the group. In consequence, groups too
often fail to make the best choice—one that is
fully informed by all the available information.
In the case of COVID-19, even if some members of the group are aware of data that accurately signal the magnitude of the threat, their
voices will not be heard as the group discusses
the crisis (Stasser & Abele, 2020).
Unfortunately, people do not recognize the
extent to which their opinions, beliefs, and behaviors are influenced by those around them
(Cialdini, 2005). They often assume that they

based their response on this rational analysis,
when in actuality, their responses are determined by social comparison biases, overreliance on shared information, and conformity to
group norms. For example, the data that they
themselves gather locally—from those they interact with—tend to influence people even more
than they realize. As Zell and Alicke (2010)
discovered in their studies of the local dominance effect, people’s judgments are more influenced by their close social contacts rather
than the more diffuse data based on the responses of thousands of people. Yet when asked
to describe their metacognitive processing of
the information, people were certain that they
were relying on the data from the highly representative sample rather than the anecdotal case
data provided to them by their associates.
Socializing or Quarantining
Because there was no known cure for the
disease, nor a vaccine that would prevent infection, public health authorities relied on NPIs to
limit the spread of the disease within the population. In particular, the CDC advised individuals to maintain social distance (www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/), and state officials included this
requirement in the health mandates.
NPIs were medically necessary, but limiting
individuals’ contact with other people blocked
them from the primary means of coping with the
stress of traumatic events: their groups. Those
who study mental health—clinical, counseling,
community, and health psychologists, social
workers, and psychiatrists—have long recognized the relationship between groups and
members’ psychological well-being. Theory
and research suggest that people need to be
connected to other people and that, if these
connections are severed, they experience significant psychological distress. As Baumeister and
Leary (1995) suggested, humans have a powerful need to belong: “a pervasive drive to form
and maintain at least a minimum quantity of
lasting, positive, and impactful interpersonal relationships” (p. 497). They likened the need to
belong to other basic needs, such as hunger or
thirst. Individuals therefore, under most circumstances, resist isolation and seclusion; they
choose to affiliate with others rather than be
alone.
This need to belong is strongest when people
face a stressful, uncertain future. In times of
trouble, such as illness, catastrophe, natural disaster, or financial upheaval, they seek out comfort and support by joining with other people
(Rofé, 1984). Decades of research on coping
confirms the stress-affiliation effect: People
seek out others as a coping mechanism to acquire reassuring information germane to the
threat, secure emotional support, and acquire
tangible aid (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1997; Cohen
& Wills, 1985; Hill, 1987). This reaction is, in
most cases, an adaptive one, for affiliating with
others reduces morbidity and mortality, modulates key neural and biological responses to
stress, and reduces the negative effects of major
stressful life events (see Taylor, 2011 for a
review). However, in the case of a threat of a
contagious disease, the need to belong compels
individuals to seek out association with others
even though that association is unhealthy.
In consequence, despite warnings to avoid
groups, many people continued to join them,
even though that risky socializing provided the
disease the opportunity to spread from the infected to the uninfected. When surveyed after
the CDC released its guidelines of social distancing (March 17–20, 2020), many people reported actions that were inconsistent with the
mandate: They were continuing to join with
others in face-to-face social groups, sit side by
side in public settings, and take part in large
social gatherings without face coverings (R.
Forsyth, 2020). These individuals, in general,
were not the people in the sample who felt they
were unlikely to contract the illness or those
who believed they would survive the illness. In
fact, recognition that the virus was a significant
health threat and that they would likely contract
it were associated with more, rather than less,
risky socializing. Disregarding the mandate to
socially distance was also associated with dispositional differences in respondents’ preference to join with others when stressed (Hill,
1987). Those who engaged in risky socializing
were also people who were more likely to agree
with statements such as “If I feel unhappy or
kind of depressed (stressed), I usually try to be
around other people to make me feel better” and
“One of my greatest sources of comfort when
things get rough is being with other people”
(Hill, 1987, p. 1011).

As the number of COVID-19 cases increased,
the CDC urged individuals to continue taking
precautions to minimize the spread of the virus,
including maintaining social distance, avoiding
groups, and wearing face coverings. However,
many people resisted this mandate. Churches
continued to hold services, people congregated
in parks, beaches, and clubs, and travel resumed. The CDC’s requirement to wear facecovering became, over time, a contentious, politically charged issue, and the media reported
multiple incidents of confrontations between
the masked and unmasked (McKelvey, 2020).
In some cases, large groups of people gathered
publicly to protest the mandates, displaying a
marked consistency in their actions and attitudes.
No one factor distinguishes those who adopted the mandated NPIs and those who resisted. Some who refused to comply did not
think the disease was a significant threat to
them, personally (e.g., Harper, Satchell, Fido, &
Latzman, 2020). Individuals with certain
traits—such as elevated levels of narcissism and
psychopathy—complied less than people
whose personalities did not include these dark
triad characteristics (Nowa et al., 2020). However, group-level processes likely also generated this marked variance in response to the
CDC’s NPIs. The pandemic restricted people’s
contact with other people, and so reduced the
density and heterogeneity of their social networks. This isolation, combined with the tendency to maximize cohesion during periods of
stress, likely resulted in both polarization and an
increased identification with the group and its
norms. Those norms, in some cases, stressed
compliance: that taking steps to minimize the
spread of the virus was the socially approved
course of action, and that not complying would
be considered unusual and inappropriate. But in
some social groups, noncompliance became the
norm. These groups maintained that government authorities had no right to curtail people’s
freedom to assemble, travel, and work, and so
wearing a mask in public or quarantining was
considered socially indefensible by the members of these groups. In consequence, noncompliance came to be associated with group identity. As social identity theory suggests, when
people categorize themselves as members of a
particular group they subsequently strive to act,
think, and feel in ways that they believe are
prototypical for a member of that group (Hogg,
Hains, & Mason, 1998). Sustained, psychologically, but this collectively shared social identity, those who resisted compliance acted in
ways that spread rather than controlled a deadly
disease (D. Forsyth, 2020).
Protection: Coping During the
COVID-19 Crisis
How do we endure when forced to cope with
the long-term effects of a pandemic like COVID19? We have addressed the challenges to prevent
the spread of the disease, but there are other struggles caused by COVID-19. There is the stress of
isolation on groups of people, such as families
who are sequestered from the outside world.
There is also ongoing risk of getting sick, job loss
and financial insecurity, and the death of loved
ones. Not to mention the stress of racial and
economic inequities and an overwhelmed
health care system. Psychologists have studied the impact of each of these on well-being,
and they provide important guidance as we
navigate the ways social groups and group
therapy can help people cope.
Experiences in Isolated Groups: The Value
of Cohesion
During COVID-19, many families were isolated from the outside world. How did people
cope when their social networks shrink from
many to very few? Did they seize this time of
enforced togetherness to strengthen their attachments to one another—to share, support, and
appreciate each other? Or did boredom, tension,
and conflict grow with each passing day?
Studies of groups that have spent long periods of time in isolation, such as teams stationed
in Antarctica and explorers living for months on
end in a confined space, suggest that some
groups will prosper, but others will falter under
the strain. During the International Geophysical
Year (1957–1958), for example, several countries sent small groups of military and civilian
personnel to outposts in Antarctica. These
groups were responsible for collecting data
about that largely unknown continent, but the
violent weather forced the staff to remain indoors most of the time. As months went by with

and group members’ initial friendliness, good
humor, and sensitivity were replaced with lethargy, low morale, grouchiness, and boredom.
Other groups, however, manage to prosper
when cut off from the outside world. Some of
the isolated groups studied by researchers at the
Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda,
Maryland, for example, responded quite positively when sequestered. These researchers confined pairs of volunteers to a 12-by-12-foot
room with no means of interacting with anyone
outside of that space—no computer, no Internet,
no media. Some of these groups imploded—
they insisted they be released from the study
after only a few days. Others, however, thrived.
Over the course of the isolation, their reliance
on one another strengthened, as did their satisfaction with their circumstances. They shared
concerns and worries about how they were dealing with the isolation and made adjustments
whenever conflicts and tensions arose. They set
up schedules of activities, even agreeing on a
plan of action for meals, exercise, and recreation. Cooperation, then, was critical. As one
person who spent considerable time in an isolated group in an underwater habitat, SEALAB,
explained, “If we hadn’t had a real compatible
group there might have been a lot of hard feelings. Everybody was cooperative. They all
worked and helped each other as much as possible. I think it was a real good group” (Radloff
& Helmreich, 1968, p. 82). The successful
groups also avoided one of the symptoms of
maladaptive responding displayed by the less
successful groups: withdrawal. The members of
groups that did not cope well with isolation,
over time, tended to stop interacting with each
other—they cocooned instead of communicating, collaborating, cooperating, and caring for
one another (Radloff & Helmreich, 1968).
What we can learn from this study of groups
in isolation is that group cohesion is one of the
factors that helps groups survive during times of
distress. It is the glue that keeps people together
when things are challenging in the group, such
as conflict within the group. During this pandemic, many people have been in groups such
as health care workers helping patients with
COVID-19, employees engaging in online
zoom meetings, or families socially isolating
together. It is important for us to understand
how to facilitate cohesion within these groups
and to tolerate conflict when it surfaces. Group
researchers and therapists have long recognized
the importance of group cohesion and studied
how it facilitates safety and the ability to tolerate tensions in the group (Yalom & Leszcz,
2005).
The bonds between the members of cohesive
groups are strong and not easily broken, and
these bonds sustain members’ sense of wellbeing. Several studies have indicated that cohesion positively correlates with an elevation in
members’ self-esteem, reduced symptoms, and
higher rates of goal attainment (Braaten, 1989;
Budman et al., 1989; Tschuschke & Dies,
1994). In families, cohesion is negatively related to loneliness, and family cohesion also can
decrease loneliness for family members (Fujimori, Hayashi, Fujiwara, & Matsusaka, 2017).
A meta-analysis examining the relationship between cohesion and group therapy treatment
outcome in 40 studies indicated that cohesion
significantly related to outcome in both inpatient and outpatient settings (Burlingame, McClendon, & Yang, 2018).
How do we foster cohesion in groups? This is
an important question, and group dynamic researchers and group therapists have focused on
the impact of empathy in the group. Johnson,
Burlingame, Olsen, Davies, and Gleave (2005)
found that empathy by leaders and/or members
related to perceived positive relationships
within the group. Researchers also have shown
that leaders who promote interpersonal interaction and prioritize the cultivation of cohesion
also facilitate a greater bond between members
(Burlingame et al., 2018).
One of the most inhibiting leadership factors
is the leader’s inability to tolerate emotional
reactions (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016). Failure
to be able to express or accept caring, to address
conflict, or to explore members’ avoidant behaviors (e.g., missed sessions/tardy behavior)
negatively influences the development of cohesion within a group (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005).
Social psychologists found that the more a
leader engaged in avoidant behaviors, such as
dismissing vulnerability/avoiding members’
needs, the less group members rated group cohesion (Davidovitz, Mikulincer, Shaver, Izsak,
& Popper, 2007). Similarly, Smokowski, Rose,
Todar, and Reardon (1999) found that dropout
from the group increased when group members

supporting or protecting them.
During COVID-19, people are often interacting in groups. Many are cloistered with family
for long periods of time in isolation, medical
teams are working together in high-stress situations, and government groups are negotiating
supplies to protect health care workers. It is
helpful to recognize how the research on cohesion can influence these groups. To increase
cohesion within these groups, one needs to have
leaders who invite open conversations among
members that encourage differences and disagreements (Burlingame, Fuhriman, & Johnson,
2002; Yalom & Leszcz, 2005). In medical
teams, cohesion is critical. Brindley, Mosier,
and Hicks (2020) studied how clear tasks and
preparation enhanced cohesion, which is necessary when establishing an airway for patients
sick with COVID-19. In all groups, there needs
to be an awareness of the impact of race, ethnicity, and culture (DeLlucia-Waack, 2011).
Leaders who are not able to help the group
examine and resolve conflicts around diversity
will have members experience discrimination
and prejudice in the group that is likely to erode
group cohesion.
Loneliness and the Benefit of Groups
When the public is required to social distance
to protect others and oneself from exposure to a
virus, there is a likelihood that some people will
experience more isolation and loneliness, while
others can social distance and remain socially
connected. We know that being socially connected positively influences psychological and
emotional well-being, physical health (Uchino,
2006), and life expectancy (Holt-Lunstad,
Smith, Baker, Harris, & Stephenson, 2015;
Shor, Roelfs, & Yogev, 2013). Unfortunately,
many people may not be as fortunate and will
experience disconnection and isolation that
causes depression, anxiety, and stress (Bai et al.,
2004; Mihashi et al., 2009). Brooks et al. (2020)
reviewed the effects of quarantine and found
that there were long-lasting effects of being
quarantined that exist years later, especially for
health care workers, and these effects included
avoiding people who could be sick and avoiding
work.
Researchers have shown that loneliness can
have long-term deleterious effects, and it is a
subjective experience. People can feel alone
even when with their families or in groups.
Holt-Lunstad et al. (2015) found, even after
accounting for multiple factors, that increased
likelihood of death was 26% for reported loneliness, 29% for social isolation, and 32% for
living alone. The results indicated no difference
between objective and subjective measures of
social isolation when predicting mortality. It
seems as though any kind of loneliness can be a
health risk. This is especially important during
COVID-19 when people are distancing and
feeling more isolated.
We know that joining groups is one way
individuals can cope with loneliness and isolation (Forsyth, 2018). When people struggle with
these feelings, they often seek out support
groups to feel less alone (Forsyth & Elliott,
1999). In addition to support groups, people
seek out group psychotherapy to help them feel
less alone and to address important issues.
Yalom and Leszcz (2005) describe how being
with others in the group who experience similar
feelings is one of the most curative aspects of
groups.
One subset of the population that has been hit
particularly hard is the elderly. The elderly are
required to socially isolate more to prevent serious illness and are more likely to feel more
isolated. Researchers have applied a psychosocial group intervention for lonely older people,
and it has been effective at increasing social
activation, new friendships, and remaining in
the group, as well as improved well-being and
subjective health and decreasing need for health
services (Supiano & Luptak, 2014).
Unemployment, Financial Loss,
and Group Support
One of the major stressors for individuals
during a pandemic is job loss, the requirement
to stay home, and the rise in unemployment.
According to Brooks et al. (2020), financial loss
during quarantine related to psychological disorders, anger, and anxiety. They also found that
delays in receiving government funding and
having a lower income in general before the
quarantine had a negative impact.
Groups provide support for those during
times of layoff, and spending time with fellow
coworkers can facilitate coping (Cooper, 1981).
Social support also has been shown to moderate

Gallo, & Marshall, 2020), but this was related to
race, education, and prior social support before
the loss of employment. In essence, White, educated individuals with prior social support
benefited the most from social support after
involuntary job loss to reduce depression. The
findings expose the different experience of job
loss during a pandemic and the importance of
examining how job loss and unemployment due
to COVID-19 affect people differently depending on economic status and race.
Social Inequality and Groups
to Promote Change
As we started to see who was impacted most
by COVID-19, we learned that not everyone
was affected the same way. Minorities, especially Black minorities, had the highest rate of
mortality in major cities that were hit hard by
the virus. According to Yancy (2020), 50–70%
of COVID deaths were Black individuals even
when they represented 14–30% of the total population of a city. A similar pattern is found
globally with predominantly Black countries
having the greatest infection and death rate
compared to predominantly White countries. Issues of racism, discrimination, and health care
inequities add incredible stress to individuals
and relate to mental (Carter & Forsyth, 2010;
Murali & Oyebode, 2004; Schwartz, 2017) and
physical health (Sacker, Head, Gimeno, & Bartley, 2009). They also relate to coping with the
additional trauma of COVID-19.
Although discrimination by groups has a negative impact on health (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009), groups also can provide a resource
for minorities and marginalized populations.
Belonging to groups with others who have similar experiences increases a sense of belonging
and provides support. Groups that invite people
of different backgrounds and identities also promote social justice and change. Frantell, Miles,
and Ruwe (2019) reviewed the importance of
intergroup dialogues and that bringing people
with different identities together fosters intergroup relationships, develops self-awareness,
and promotes social justice. These types of
group conversations are critical during COVID19, when we are also facing a time when we are
seeing higher mortality of minorities, health
care inequalities, and increased racism.
Complicated Bereavement and Group
Intervention
During COVID-19, many people lost loved
ones suddenly from the virus and were not able
to comfort their dying family members or engage in funerals with family and friends. The
lack of support, religious rituals, and physical
proximity to family has led some to experience
complicated bereavement (Burke & Neimeyer,
2013). Complicated bereavement occurs when
individuals have an intense grief response that
lasts longer and eventually influences one’s
daily functioning. Mayland, Harding, Preston,
and Payne (2020) reviewed studies of prior pandemics and found that the multiplicity of the
losses, inability to say “goodbye,” and disruptions in the social connections all contributed to
complicated bereavement during pandemics.
They suggested that providing group connections and increasing support would help people
during COVID-19.
Groups have been used effectively to help
people cope with grief and loss (Maass, Hofmann, Perlinger, & Wagner, 2020; Piper,
Ogrodniczuk, Joyce, & Weideman, 2011). They
provide emotional support and hope and reduce
depression caused by isolation. Supiano,
Haynes, and Pond (2017) did a qualitative study
of members in a short-term grief group and
found they were able to help facilitate meaning
out of catastrophic grief experiences. During
COVID-19, online groups have been used to
provide support to health care providers (Wallace, Wladkowski, Gibson, & White, 2020) and
individuals struggling with the loss of a loved
one (Sun, Bao, & Lu, 2020). Wallace et al.
(2020) recommend online support groups for
those individuals providing palliative care for
those who are dying of COVID-19. Knowles,
Stelzer, Jovel, and O’Connor (2017) examined
the effectiveness of a virtual support group for
the elderly experiencing the loss of a spouse and
found that the members had better sleep, less
depression, less ruminations of the spouse, and
less loneliness after the group intervention.
Mayland et al. (2020) suggests that providing
technologically assisted social support during
illness, prior to death, and after the loss could
decrease complicated mourning. They recommend online group-related support during
COVID-19 that includes family gatherings and
religious rituals involving the community.
GROUP AND COVID-19 129

During COVID-19
When people are suffering, groups provide
healing. They bring hope, decrease isolation,
and connect us to something bigger than our
own pain and loneliness (Yalom & Leszcz,
2005). That is why it is not surprising that group
therapy is one of the most effective treatments
to restore us during and after COVID-19.
General Evidence of Group Therapy
Group therapy has been recently described as
a “triple E treatment” (Burlingame & Strauss, in
press; Yalom & Leszcz, 2005). It is effective,
equivalent, and efficient. Randomized clinical
trials (RCTs) have shown it to be effective when
contrasted with no-treatment controls. A recent
meta-analysis of nearly 50 RCTs that contrasted
individual and group therapy formats using
identical patients, treatments, and dose produced equivalent outcomes compared to individual treatment (Burlingame, Seebeck, Janis,
et al., 2016). Furthermore, equivalence also has
been found when group therapy is contrasted
with other bona fide treatments for common
anxiety and mood disorders (Burlingame &
Strauss, in press). Finally, when one considers
therapist time and treatment cost, group therapy
is a more efficient treatment when compared to
individual therapy (Burlingame et al., 2016).
COVID-19: Evidence Base for
Group Therapy
Global (WHO) and national health care agencies (CDC) have reported an increased prevalence of mental problems related to COVID-19
(Qiu et al. (2020); Zhang et al., 2020). Group
interventions may be an important option to
prevent and restore mental health problems related to this pandemic. A recent review (e.g.,
Burlingame & Strauss, in press) provides ample
evidence for the efficacy of group treatment
with respect to specific psychological disorders
that may be triggered by the pandemic. In general, findings from 329 randomized controlled
studies that treated 27,000 patients showed
large effects favoring group treatment over
waitlist controls and no differences to active
controls. What follows is a brief summary of
major conclusions regarding the efficacy of
group therapy for anxiety, trauma, mood, and
substance abuse disorders.
Obsessive– compulsive disorder (OCD).
Individuals suffering from OCD report aggravations of their symptoms, especially fear of
contamination and excessive washing of hands
during COVID-19 (Kumar & Somani, 2020).
The lack of inhibitory control as a result of the
pandemic and its consequences is seen as one of
the roots for the increase of symptoms needing
additional treatment options. As far as group
treatment is concerned, Schwartze, Barkowski,
Burlingame, Strauss, and Rosendahl (2016)
summarized three most commonly administered
group treatment comparisons in a meta-analysis
of 12 studies and 832 adult patients: complex
cognitive–behavioral group treatment (CBGT;
13), exposure with response prevention alone
(two), and cognitive therapy (one). No significant differences were found between group psychotherapy and active treatments (e.g., individual psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or
common factors), and a similar pattern of findings was evident on secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety).
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
China indicated that PTSD is one of the mental
health consequences of COVID-19 (Tang et al.,
2020). For example, they reported the incidence
of traumatic stress in medical staff was 27% in
a sample of 230 nurses and doctors. The entire
sample, on average, scored high in the PTSD
self-rating scale (Huang & Zhao, 2020). In a
recent meta-analysis studying PTSD (Schwartze, Barkowski, Strauss, Knaevelsrud, & Rosendahl, 2019), 20 group treatment studies comprising 2,244 individuals diagnosed with PTSD
were summarized. As expected, the clinical
characteristics (e.g., trauma type, comorbidity,
severity of PTSD, personal background of participants) varied across studies. Nevertheless,
those receiving group treatment experienced
improvement in PTSD, anxiety, and depression
symptoms compared to no treatment (g  0.70).
Based on these studies, group psychotherapy
appears to be an efficacious treatment for
PTSD, although there are insufficient trials to
test for equivalence between group and individual treatment.
Anxiety disorders. Reports so far indicate
an increase of anxiety and panic symptoms and
anxiety disorders as an immediate consequence
of the COVID-19 pandemic (Huang & Zhao,
130 MARMAROSH, FORSYTH, STRAUSS, AND BURLINGAME
This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.
This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.2020; Rajkumar, 2020), raising the question of
how effective treatments for patients suffering
from panic and combined anxiety disorders can
benefit from group treatments. The effects of
CBGT were assessed in a recent meta-analysis
comprising RCTs of group treatments for panic
disorder (Schwartze et al., 2017). A large effect
for CBGT was found on panic and agoraphobia
symptoms when compared to no-treatment controls (g  1.08), and no differences were found
when CBGT was compared to treatments (g 
0.18) including individual therapy. Over three
fourths (78%) of patients were panic-free after
group psychotherapy compared to 33% in the
waitlist control condition. Thus, CBGT appears
to be a robust treatment for panic disorder.
Major depressive disorder (MDD). As
with the other psychological disorders, an increase of depressive symptoms and depressive
disorders is expected and described following
the outbreak of COVID-19 (Huang & Zhao,
2020; Rajkumar, 2020; Tang et al., 2020). It is
assumed that the feeling of a lack of control
paired with the consequences of social and
physical distancing directly affects the mood of
individuals especially in countries and regions
with high rates of cases and deaths due to the
virus. Janis, Svien, Jensen, and Burlingame (in
press) pooled the findings from 35 studies (47
comparisons) and 2,918 individuals diagnosed
with MDD who were treated with group treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), medication, or
no treatment. The most frequent treatment was
CBGT (14), followed by mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy (MBCT; six) and psychoeducational groups (PEGs; six). The combined
effect of group treatment on depression symptoms was large (g  .86) when compared to no
treatment, with patients being nearly 7 times
more likely to have improved by the end of
treatment. There was strong support for CBGT
and promising evidence supporting both MBCT
and PEGs when compared to no-treatment controls.
Substance abuse disorders (SUDs). An
increase of substance abuse, especially alcohol,
has been assumed to be a consequence of
COVID-19 (Clay & Parker, 2020; Galea, Merchant, & Lurie, 2020). Ornell et al. (2020) advocate a reinforcement of addiction care for
several reasons: Individuals with SUD are considered to be a population at risk for contamination (e.g., due to their clinical and psychosocial condition), and these individuals are also
expected to have problems with treatment access as well as adherence due to the changes in
social life and economy caused by the pandemic.
Recently, a meta-analysis of RCTs focusing
on SUDs in adults (Lo Coco et al., 2019) summarized 33 studies comprising 34 comparisons
with nine studies comparing group to notreatment controls, seven comparing group to
individual therapy, and 18 comparing group
treatment to other treatments (e.g., twelve-steps,
TAU). The group treatments included cognitive
behavioral therapy, behavioral, mindfulness, dialectical behavior therapy, and integrated treatments. Group treatment outperformed individual therapy with moderate effects.
Groups and facilitating immune functioning. Moreover, there may be added benefit beyond the traditional psychological outcomes given recent evidence on the impact of
group treatments on the immune system
(Shields, Spahr, & Slavich, 2020). An understandable consequence of the pandemic is an
increase of general and specific stress for individuals in countries with a high prevalence of
COVID-19 infections. During stress, the sympathetic nervous system suppresses antiviral
processes and up-regulates proinflammatory
processes via the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (Slavich & Irwin, 2014). Stress responses
keep us in a constant state of fight or flight
(Sapolsky, 2004). Further, there is evidence for
psychosocial stress suppressing cellular and humoral immunity and increasing nonspecific inflammation (Segerstrom & Miller, 2004; Slavich & Irwin, 2014).
Psychosocial interventions appear to exert a
positive effect on immunity (Kim & Su, 2020).
A recent meta-analysis by Shields et al. (2020)
documents psychosocial intervention’s impact
on the immune system, which is causally involved in 50% of deaths worldwide (Furman
et al., 2019). Shields et al. also demonstrated
that group interventions were equally if not
more effective than individual therapy. The social milieu that groups provide may be a “motivator” to encourage attendance, which in turn
adds a supportive social environment linked to
health-related biomarkers. This social milieu
creates an opportunity to interact with affected
peers and experience therapeutic factors such as
the instillation of hope, universality, altruism,

been empirically linked to better outcomes.
Online Group Therapy: Adjusting to
COVID-19
Although the online modes of group therapy
have existed, it has grown exponentially with
COVID-19 (Aafjes-van Doorn, Békès, & Prout,
2020; APA, 2020; Burlingame, Strauss, &
Joyce, 2013). As therapists shift to telehealth
during COVID-19, it is important to examine
the current group research, benefits, and limits
to online group interventions (Weinberg, 2020).
Synchronous groups. Synchronous online
groups consist of chat rooms as well as live
group conferences where participants meet with
each other and the therapist. The efficacy of
these interventions has been tested in several
RCTs with larger samples made up of different
clinical problems (eating disorders, depression,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, cancer,
social anxiety disorder, and being a victim of
family violence). Some studies support their
efficacy when compared to waitlist or TAU
conditions (e.g., Crisp, Griffiths, Mackinnon,
Bennett, & Christensen, 2014; van der Zanden,
Kramer, Gerrits, Cuijpers, 2012), while others
indicate format equivalence when compared to
asynchronous group treatments (Burlingame &
Strauss, in press). Users commonly report a
high degree of satisfaction and indicate that the
online group was an important source to increase coping (Hopf, Grange, Moessner, &
Bauer, 2013; Stephen et al., 2013). These are
the types of groups being used now during
COVID-19.
Benefits and limitations of online groups.
Internet-based (group) treatments can be less
stigmatizing, especially for young people and
those with limited access to psychosocial support. Moreover, the average amount of therapist
weekly time per participant can be significantly
reduced (up to 71%) when compared to traditional CBGT (Schulz et al., 2016) and equally
effective (Tate et al., 2017). These benefits are
balanced by other ethical challenges regarding
confidentiality. Weinberg and Rolnick (2019)
described evidence that screen relations may
reduce interpersonal connections (e.g., Russell,
2015) and highlighted obstacles when one shifts
from traditional group practice to the screen.
These include (a) loss of control, (b) limited
bodily interactions, (c) inability to read and
respond to verbal and nonverbal signals, and (d)
the meaning of a member’s background—if it
should be considered or ignored. In short, we
are still building what good practice means and
for whom these groups even might be adverse
or harmful (Weinberg & Rolnick, 2019).
Despite the limitations, video conferences in
times of COVID-19 seem to be accepted and
perceived as helpful by patients and providers
(e.g., Liu et al., 2020). There is evidence to
suggest that online support groups help those
who are quarantined during disease outbreaks.
Pan, Chang, and Yu (2005) found that having an
online support group and feeling connected to
others who had been through the same situation
was validating, and it provided people with the
support they needed. Indeed, the scientific literature on videoconferencing is more plentiful on
individual (Backhaus et al., 2012; Rees & Maclaine, 2015) rather than group treatment. The
pandemic already has begun to produce more
publications on online group treatment (Dehkordi, Sakhi, Gholamzad, Azizpor, & Shahini,
2020), and the sustainability of an online group
treatment using different theoretical orientations is an open question.
Implications
It is critical that we examine the group-level
processes pertaining to the prevention, maintenance, and restoration during COVID-19. Although we often are aware of the individual
factors that are emphasized as we navigate this
pandemic, the social factors are equally important. Group dynamics influence the tension we
see when people are ambivalent about wearing
masks or social distancing, the ways people
cope with social isolation, and the ways groups
can provide relief from depression, anxiety,
substance abuse, and loss.
Working Together to Cope With
COVID-19
Groups also bring together different disciplines to understand the diverse challenges
ahead of us as we endure COVID-19 (Holmes et
al., 2020). According to O’Connor et al. (2020),
it requires a group of researchers and clinicians
across professions to address the impact of
COVID-19. No single disciple can tackle this

also argue that there needs to be collaboration
between the public, patients, health care providers, and policymakers and a cohesive focused
research agenda that can influence policy and
practice. Group is indeed a specialty within
psychology that will help us navigate people’s
psychological and physical well-being, increase
successful health care delivery, fight systemic
injustices, develop public policy, and work together to develop a vaccination for COVID-19.
Group Leadership During COVID-19
One of the most valuable lessons we learned
from the research on cohesion is the role of the
leader in facilitating successful group dynamics.
Burlingame et al. (2002) described the many
things leaders can do to facilitate successful
group process and outcome such as modeling
interpersonal feedback, helping members tolerate conflict, embracing vulnerability, and discussing clear goals for the group. Research findings suggest that it is also important to
empathize with members (Johnson et al., 2005)
and be supportive when members are distressed
(Davidovitz et al., 2007). It is important for
political leaders and health care leaders to be
aware that the public is needing support, direction, and empathy during the pandemic.
Group Psychotherapy and Online Groups
One of the most important messages is that
group psychotherapy is an effective treatment,
as effective as individual psychotherapy (Burlingame, Seebeck, Janis, et al., 2016), and that it
is an important treatment for those suffering
during COVID-19. Individuals with anxiety,
depression, grief, loneliness, and substance
abuse can get help during the pandemic with
online therapy group interventions. Although
we are only beginning to understand the differences between online group therapy and faceto-face treatment, we are seeing the benefits of
being able to reach out to diverse populations
while ensuring the safety of people who are
isolating to prevent the spread of the virus. Our
ability to engage socially while also protecting
ourselves from illness makes online groups one
of the most important resources during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract
The biggest challenge humanity is facing right now is to curtail the outspread of COVID-19. To make this 
successful, people need to adopt precautions of social interaction and health hygiene, as recommended by 
WHO. Recent evidence indicates that the public tends to take a casual approach towards this 
recommendation, especially those which pertain to social distancing. Using the health belief model as a 
guiding theory, we recommend public awareness campaigns to focus on creating awareness regarding the 
potential benefits of the preventive approach, seriousness, and susceptibility of disease. Besides, authorities 
should also create an environment so that people face fewer barriers in adopting preventive measures. We 
also highlighted the potential role of positive psychology during COVID-19.

Although the pandemic COVID-19 caused by the SARS-COV-2 
virus is not the first in the 21st century, it has already surpassed the 
outreach and death toll of all previous pandemics. According to the 
WHO situation report published on 7th May 2020, there are 
approximately 3.5 million cases of COVID-19 and 250 thousand deaths 
worldwide. Even though there is about 86% similarity between the 
genetic structures of SARS, which first appeared in 2003 (LeDuc and 
Barry, 2004) and SARS-COV-2, the latter has proven to be highly 
contagious. Not only does it transfer through direct body contact or 
being very close to the infected patients, but there are also indications 
that it can transfer within 6 to 12 feet of contact (Lai et al., 2020). Initial 
evidence also indicated that it could survive on inanimate objects, and 
a person can catch the virus if it touches the contaminated surface. 
Although the virus cannot penetrate the skin, yet if the contaminated 
hands touch the mouth, nose, or eyes, one can easily get infected 
(Centers for Disease Control, 2020). 
Early experiences with other types of recent outbreaks involving 
novel viruses such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), 
SARS, Swine Flu, H1N1, and others have taught us that "being 
prepared" is just an illusion. When faced with a new type of virus, 
countries are always looking for new but urgent public health strategies 
to minimize and eventually contain the spread of the pandemic. 
However, all sorts of the epidemics that involve highly communicable 
viruses have shown that an individual needs to play an essential role in 
the containment and mitigation of the spread (Leung et al., 2005), 
especially when there is no vaccination as in the case of COVID-19 
(Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, international and local health agencies, 
as well as governments, are emphasizing the citizens to follow the 
precautionary guidelines as recommended by the World Health 
Organization. These guidelines for unaffected individuals include 
thoroughly washing hands with soap or alcoholic sanitizer; maintaining 
a minimum of three feet (six feet is preferred) distance with another 
person at a social place; covering the face (with tissue or elbow) when 
coughing or sneezing and hence maintaining a good respiratory 
hygiene; avoiding crowded places, and to the extent possible 
maintaining social isolation by staying at home. For those who feel 
they have symptoms of some respiratory disease such as fever, cough,
or difficulty in breathing, the direction given is to contact health 
professionals (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020). 
COVID-19 is significantly different from many previous 
contamination diseases due to its unlimited infectious period, severe 
transmissibility, clinical severity, and the extent of its spread in the 
community. Even a healthy individual can be a passive carrier and 
responsible for the transmission of disease in the community. That is 
why social isolation, as a crucial means and effective way of breaking 
the chain of infection (Huremović, 2019), is suggested for the entire 
community (or country) rather than for the infected individuals only. 
Governments, all over the world, are putting their best efforts to 
mitigate the disease. They have taken steps such as imposing 
lockdowns, closing airports, restricting social gatherings and 
movements, and establishing health care and quarantine facilities (Ren 
et al., 2020). In addition, various awareness campaigns are launched to 
educate the public about COVID-19 and the importance of adopting 
precautionary measures against it. But can the governments maintain 
lockdowns for a long time? It is not possible as it is hurting the 
economy. Trade and commerce activities have come to a halt,
consequently giving rise to unemployment and reduction in income 
(Wilder-Smith et al., 2020). International Monetary Fund (2020) 
estimates that the current recession is comparable to the great recession 
that occurred in the 1920s. Governments need to make a balance 
between their lives and livelihoods. Many countries have decided to 
relax lockdown restrictions. So there will be resuming of some 
economic and social activities too. In such a scenario, the role of an 
individual to prevent themselves from the prevalent disease is going to 
be undoubtedly very important. Journal of Research in Psychology, 2(1); 1-3

With the relaxation in the restrictions of lockdown, new operating 
rules, including social distancing, are being established for the safety 
of the people with the warning that failure to take precautionary action 
can lead to the severity of the situation and then people will be in 
lockdown once more. Here some questions arise. Is it possible for 
people to resume social and economic activities while maintaining 
some form of social distancing and healthy practices to limit the 
outbreak? And when hope and worry are being mingled, would they 
be able to cope with the situation mentally and psychologically? It 
seems most of the community is feeling relaxed with the relaxation in 
the lockdown restrictions. There are two reasons that people are not 
letting go the social life. First is that they do not understand the gravity 
of the situation and want to enjoy their social freedom, as we witnessed 
in some of the developed countries like the U.S.A. and Europe (Pinkser, 
2020). The last pandemic of nearly such intensity occurred a century 
ago; the contemporary public cannot comprehend the disastrous 
aftermath an exponential spread of disease can result in. Adjustment 
and anchoring heuristics can be used to explain this judgmental bias in 
this type of scenario. The second possible reason is that there are people 
who have a challenge of survival when there is no income. For them,
the disease would not be the priority but to feed themselves and their 
families. 
Media plays a vital role in sharing information all around the world 
as well as in regulating the emotions of the public. It often happens that 
it corrupts the message with wrong details, manipulates the perception, 
or using a sensational tone, which stokes unnecessary fear and panic 
among the public. The reactions and responses of media coverage of 
the current ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus are variant. On the one 
hand, there is an attack of anxiety and restlessness in people who are 
hyper-vigilant and over-cautious. News about the spread of pandemic 
gives them the understanding that they are facing a traumatic event. 
They experience headaches, muscle aches, and stomach-aches. Their 
sleeping and eating pattern disrupts.
On the other hand, some people do not take the news seriously as 
they already have low trust in media and aware of the notoriety of 
media information. It was observed that such individuals, even in some 
developed countries like the U.S.A. and parts of Europe, were not 
willing to let go of their social interactions even during the high peak 
of pandemic in their countries. They might spread the virus 
unknowingly. 
In addition to imposing rules and regulations regarding social 
interactions, authorities can launch large scale interventions to educate 
the masses towards adopting a preventive lifestyle. Public health 
agencies can utilize the psychologist to design awareness campaigns so 
that the public willingly follow all the protocols of social interaction 
that are required to minimize the spread of COVID-19. A preventive 
health behavior framework that can provide the guidelines in this 
regard is the health belief model (HBM: Rosenstock, 1974). In H.B.M., 
there are four determinants of preventive health behavior, perceived 
susceptibility (P-Sus), perceived severity (P-Sev), perceived benefits 
(P-ben), and perceived barriers (P-bar) to disease. P-Sus and P-Sev of 
the disease often enhance preventive behaviors by increasing an 
individual's threat appraisal for the disease. Until people are not aware 
of how serious the disease or the extent to which they are physically 
vulnerable to get infected, they would not be too eager to save 
themselves from COVID-19. P-Ben and P-Bar are collectively known 
as coping appraisals. If people are well aware of how beneficial it is for 
them to follow the precautionary protocols, there is a higher chance 
they would adopt those behaviors. Similarly, authorities need to create 
a supportive environment so that people perceive that there are low 
practical barriers in observing preventive behaviors. We recommend 
psychological researchers to explore this framework during the 
outbreak to test the efficacy of this model for COVID-19 preventive 
behavior. 
This is the time that governments need to mobilize all forms of 
communication mediums to create awareness among the public. People 
need to understand that there is no vaccination for COVID-19 (until 
now); neither lockdowns can be imposed much longer. In this regard, 
the media can be a useful tool, but it needs to understand a difference 
between sensational messages and false information, which creates 
largescale panic and informative news to enhance the four components 
of H.B.M. Although media helps create awareness, it often happens 
that it corrupts the message with wrong information or sensational tone, 
which creates unnecessary panic among the public. Dramatic and fake 
information often underplays the importance of media, especially 
social media, as a useful communication medium (Depoux et al., 2020). 
Regulatory authorities can keep a check and balance in this situation. 
We also suggest psychology researchers to explore the role of 
positive psychological characteristics during this pandemic. Previous 
research has shown that people who are high in health-based positive 
psychological capital are not only more satisfied with their health; they 
also have low B.M.I. and cholesterol levels (Luthans, Youssef, 
Sweetman, & Harms, 2013). It seems positive personality types such 
as psychological capital can act as a key resource in guiding individuals 
during the challenging times (Chen & Lim, 2012). It will enable them 
to handle the stressful situation with an optimistic, confident, hopeful 
and resilient mindset (Avey, Luthans, & Jensen, 2009) as a personality 
resource people with high psychological capital are excellent managers 
of resources. They can effectively utilize existing resources according 
to the prevalent situation and gather more useful resources for the 
future to use when demands arise (Teo, Roche, Pick, & Newton, 2014).
Coronavirus is a big challenge for a human being. People must be 
given a deep and thorough understanding of the deadly pandemic. They 
must be prepared for their current as well as prolonged post-pandemic 
effects on their lives and livings. Decisions of some countries are, to 
some extent, in the right direction. Restricted and extended lockdown 
is not the solution to this drastic scenario because it has proved to be
economically disastrous. The revival of social and economic activities 
is undeniable. Still, along with that, people should be well aware of
how they need to play their part and keep the balance in their outdoor 
activities and life-saving measures to protect themselves and their 
community. In that respect, the media and governing bodies are bound
to do their duties honestly and vigilantly in the welfare of human beings 
and humanities.

Health Psychology has received numerous papers over the past
several months on topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many of them concern depression, anxiety, stress, or other forms
of distress in the general population or in health care workers. We
have received far fewer papers on COVID-related health behaviors
and health communications—factors that have played central roles
in the spread of the pandemic and that are major topics in health
psychology.
Our experience is consistent with the published scientific literature on the pandemic. A Medline search that we conducted in late
September yielded over 23,000 English-language articles pertaining to COVID-19. Over 1,400 of them concerned topics that are
within the scope of Health Psychology. As shown in Table 1,
COVID-related mental disorders comprised the largest category.
Many other studies concerned other forms of stress or emotional
distress. At least 248 articles addressed the profound ethnic and
racial disparities in COVID-19 infection and death rates and in
access to health care that are accentuating longstanding health
inequities; 22 (9%) of these articles addressed behavioral or psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 health disparities. Thus, the literature on the behavioral and psychosocial aspects of the pandemic
has been dominated, so far at least, by research on stress or
distress. Fewer reports have been published so far on critical
COVID-related health behaviors, health communication, or health
disparities.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and other public health agencies around the world agree
that preventive health behaviors including social distancing, wearing masks, and hand washing are the keys to limiting SARSCoV-2 contagion, hospitalizations, and deaths, especially at a time
when effective vaccines are not yet available. These agencies have
identified a number of factors that increase vulnerability to SARSCoV-2 infection or that contribute to adverse outcomes, such as
obesity (Belanger et al., 2020; Tartof et al., 2020) and vaping
(Armatas et al., 2020; Dumas et al., 2020; “The EVALI Outbreak
and Vaping,” 2020) in which health behaviors also play critical
roles. They have also reported that the pandemic has created
interrelated crises of social isolation, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, violence, and domestic abuse (Chandan et al., 2020;
Czeisler et al., 2020; Devi, 2020; Makaroun et al., 2020; Ragavan
et al., 2020; Roesch et al., 2020). These health-related behavioral
and psychosocial problems have been within the province of health
psychology since its inception as a specialty.
For these reasons, the field of health psychology has a special
responsibility to apply its expertise to the psychological and social
pathologies that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,
including problems like vaccine hesitancy, resistance to preventive
health behaviors such as wearing masks, and social isolation, to
name just a few. Health psychologists can also make important
contributions to solution-focused research to improve public health
communication strategies and to develop interventions for the
long-term sequelae of COVID-19.
We also have a responsibility to address the health disparities
that have long plagued racial and ethnic minority populations and
that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Compared to the
COVID-19 pandemic, no other public health crisis has so rapidly
and convincingly demonstrated the tragic impacts of racial and
ethnic biases and other social determinants of health. A variety of

1021disadvantages such as poverty and limited access to health care
have placed people of color at elevated risk for poor health
outcomes over many decades. The CDC now recognizes that
discrimination also increases the risk of illness and death from
COVID-19 (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
Diseases Division of Viral Diseases, 2020). Racism poses an
urgent threat to the health of minority communities, and it calls for
innovative solutions and actions. Health psychology must join this
battle and become part of the solution, without delay.
Health psychologists have been taking these responsibilities
very seriously (e.g., Arden & Chilcot, 2020; Garfin et al., 2020;
Williams et al., 2020). For example, health psychologists have
been working, often within multidisciplinary collaborations, on
strategies to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Bogg &
Milad, 2020; Michie et al., 2020; Ruiz & Revenson, 2020; West et
al., 2020). They have had prominent roles in some of the most
informative early research on social and behavioral aspects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, such as in the International COVID-19
Awareness and Responses Evaluation project (Lejtenyi, 2020) and
in a study of the impact of the pandemic on physical activity in
children (Dunton et al., 2020). They have also started to address
psychosocial aspects of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID
susceptibility, care, and outcomes (e.g., Valenzuela et al., 2020;
Valrie et al., 2020).
On the contrary, some major reports on behavioral or psychosocial aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not included any
health psychologists as coauthors (e.g., Alsan et al., 2020; Bavel et
al., 2020; Shook et al., 2020). Their absence suggests that we may
need to do more to increase our visibility within the scientific
community and our participation in this vital research.
The same could be said about health psychology in the public
arena. Experts who can address the behavioral and psychosocial
aspects of the pandemic have been in great demand on news and
talk shows, newspapers, and social media. Psychologists have been
called upon many times to offer insights and advice for coping
with the pandemic, but with few exceptions (e.g., Keilar, 2020),
those who appear are usually not specialists in health psychology.
On September 9, 2020, for example, CNN ran a story under the
headline, “The Psychology Behind Why Some College Students
Break COVID-19 Rules” (Andrew, 2020). Although this story
focused on health risk behaviors, the reporter spoke with a developmental psychologist, a counseling psychologist, and a clinical
psychologist, but not with a health psychologist. Similarly, the
expert panelists at a CNN coronavirus town hall on May 21, 2020
(Cooper & Gupta, 2020) included a school psychologist and a
professor of psychology with a background in neuroscience, but
not a health psychologist.
It is understandable that the media, government agencies, school
systems, and health care organizations would turn to developmental and school psychologists for questions about the effects of the
pandemic on children, or to clinical and counseling psychologists
for questions about COVID-related mental health problems. It is
also appropriate for experts who are not psychologists to be asked
to weigh in on certain behavioral or psychosocial aspects of the
pandemic, such as when political scientists, law enforcement officials, and public health experts are asked why irate customers
would attack frontline workers for promoting compliance with
masking mandates at retail stores (MacFarquhar, 2020). Nevertheless, we believe that more could be done to ensure that health
psychologists are high on the list of experts that reporters, policymakers, and others in the public arena will call upon to address
questions about the behavioral and psychosocial aspects of the
COVID-19 pandemic as well as other public health problems and
concerns.
How we see ourselves helps to determine how others see us.
Since its inception, the field of health psychology has been preoccupied with prevalent chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes,
heart disease, and cancer, and we have paid less attention to
infectious diseases. For example, only about 8% of the thousands
of papers that have been published in Health Psychology have
focused on infectious diseases or vaccination-related topics. Most
of these reports concern HIV/AIDS (e.g., Fisher et al., 2006; Fisher
et al., 1996; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Safren et al., 2009) or other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; e.g., Corbin & Fromme, 2002;
Widman et al., 2014); only about one fifth of them focused on other
infectious diseases. This could help to explain why scientists from
other fields, policymakers, or reporters might overlook health psychologists when they need to engage experts in behavioral and psychosocial aspects of infectious diseases.
The good news is that health psychologists have shown much
more interest in infectious diseases and vaccination-related issues
in the past decade than was evident before then. Of all the papers
ever published in Health Psychology on vaccination-related issues
or infectious diseases other than STDs, 54% have been published
since 2010. Similarly, across all of the highest-impact European
and North American health psychology journals, 53% of the papers that have focused on these topics have been published since
2010. The highest impact pre-COVID papers focused on protective
health behaviors during pandemics (Bish & Michie, 2010), vaccination (Betsch & Sachse, 2013; Bish et al., 2011; Ernsting et al.,
2013; Gerend et al., 2013; Hornsey et al., 2018; Keenan et al.,
2012; Krawczyk et al., 2012; Mantzari et al., 2015), overutilization
of antibiotics (Sirota et al., 2017), hand hygiene (King et al., 2016),
susceptibility to viral challenge (Miller et al., 2016), the Ebola
epidemic (Idoiaga Mondragon et al., 2017), the H1N1 flu pandemic (Karademas et al., 2013), and infections in cancer patients
(Ruel et al., 2015).
The upsurge of interest in these topics is traceable to a series of
disconcerting developments including successive epidemics of

spread of vaccination hesitancy and antivaccination movements.
Our interest increased exponentially this year when our lives and
those of everyone around us were turned upside down, or in some
cases ended, by the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing list of
publications on behavioral and psychosocial aspects of the
COVID-19 pandemic in such high-impact journals as The Lancet
(Betsch et al., 2020) and Nature Human Behavior (Bavel et al.,
2020; Betsch, 2020) provides evidence of psychologists’ increasing visibility in work on infectious diseases and vaccination.
This is the right time to consider how the field of health
psychology can build on these developments. If there were a larger
and more visible cadre of health psychologists who specialized in
novel communicable diseases, the behavioral aspects of epidemics,
or the psychology of vaccine hesitancy, they would probably be on
speed dial at national and local media outlets at a time like this.
However, these professionals might have a challenging career path
if they were to specialize too narrowly in epidemics or pandemics.
The world has not experienced anything like COVID-19 since the
1918 flu pandemic, over 100 years ago. It seems less difficult to
build a research career or a clinical practice around the behavioral
or psychosocial aspects of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, or
cancer— conditions that are with us in large numbers every day—
than around pandemics and life-threatening epidemics that confront us only sporadically.
Despite this challenge, we believe that there are viable ways for
interested health psychologists to develop special expertise, deep
knowledge, recognition, and public visibility as experts in the
behavioral and psychosocial aspects of infectious diseases. The
development of this new subspecialty within health psychology
would be consistent with a recent call for an integrated approach to
agent, host, environmental, and behavioral factors in emerging
infectious diseases (Morens & Fauci, 2020). It would build on
adjacent areas in which health psychologists already have special
expertise such as HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., Feldstein Ewing & Bryan, 2020; Hart et al., 2017),
vaccination (e.g., Ayling et al., 2019; Bednarczyk, 2018), adherence (Bassett et al., 2019; Cornelius et al., 2018; Gathright et al.,
2017), and health disparities (Harkness et al., 2020; Hostinar et al.,
2017; Lee et al., 2017). Subspecialty training opportunities could
be developed at pre- and postdoctoral levels in departments of
psychology, psychiatry, and medicine and in health behavior divisions at schools of public health. In addition to providing a
subspecialization path for trainees with a special interest in infectious diseases, pre- and postdoctoral training programs in health
psychology should consider placing a greater emphasis across the
board on infectious diseases, public health, prevention, and health
inequities.
Finally, health psychology organizations must create more opportunities for health psychologists to apply and disseminate their
expertise in the behavioral and psychosocial aspects of infectious
diseases, vaccine hesitancy, and related problems. They should
work to ensure that health psychologists with special expertise are
visible and available when government agencies, health care organizations, or media representatives need experts in the behavioral and psychosocial aspects of infectious diseases or vaccination. We hope that health psychology organizations and training
centers will recognize the need for concerted efforts to strengthen
our role in the current pandemic and in the succession of epidemics
we will surely face in the years ahead.

ABSTRACT
COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions.
This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases
and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates
(without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and
constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on
unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based
on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been
observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly
reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be
effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19.
1. Introduction
A disease similar to pneumonia cases began to emerge in Wuhan
City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 [1,2]. The studies revealed that the cases that emerged were a new type of coronavirus that
was not previously described. This form of the virus was called Coronavirus 2019, or COVID-19, since it appeared in 2019 [3]. The source
of this virus is thought to be the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan,
China. It was understood in time that the virus, which is transmitted
from animal to human, can spread from human to human.
Although the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 transmission
pathway from human to human is still not resolved, the principle of
transmission of respiratory diseases is similar in general [4]. Respiratory diseases are spread by droplet scattering. In this type of
spreading, a sick person is exposed to this microbe to people around
him by coughing or sneezing. In other words, environmental factors
play an important role in the transmission of this virus [5].
The COVID-19 outbreak is spreading very fast every day and more
than 4 million people have been actively infected by this virus so
COVID-19 restrictions are applied in almost all areas of life [6]. The
most basic measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus or to prevent
infection is to follow hygiene rules [7]. The most important of these is
washing hands. For this reason, the spread of this virus is slower in
societies that have the habit of washing hands and pay attention to the
general hygiene rules [8]. There is a high level of participation in the
"stay at home" call by official institutions. Scientists warn that the
COVID-19 virus can reach any age group quickly [1,9].
Approximately 214 countries reported the number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases [10]. Countries have taken very strict restrictions such
as vacation for schools, working from home, quarantine for regions
with high number of cases, and most importantly, lockdown to slow
down the COVID 19 outbreak. The lockdown days differ by countries.
Countries have set the days when the lockdown started and ended according to the COVID-19 effect on their public. Some countries have
extended the lockdown by many days due to COVID-19 continues its
influence intensely on the public. Chakraborty and Maity have emphasized that the lockdown has both environmental and economic
impact on countries. The lockdown has created the ground for renewal
of the environment, especially with the closure of factories and the
reduction of both private and public transportation vehicles used.
COVID-19 increased the air quality in many parts of the world with the
lockdown imposed during the pandemic process [9]. Due to the lockdown, economic activities have stopped reducing carbon emissions
[11].
To prevent this pandemic, governments have started to apply bans
under many social restrictions. Lockdown is at the forefront of these
restrictions. The aim of this study is to analyze statistically that the
lockdown plays an important role in preventing COVID-19 and to show

Tits psychological effect on people. This study used COVID-19 data from
49 countries to analyze the impact of the lockdown to slow down the
COVID-19 outbreak. Countries that do not constantly enforce the
lockdown are not included in this study. The correlation tests were used
for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained
(Tukey-lambda).
This study includes five sections. The first section deals with the
literature review of studies related to COVID-19 pandemic. The second
part gives detailed information about the methodology of the study.
The results obtained from the method mentioned in the methodology
section are discussed in the third section. An overview of the psychological, environmental, and economic impacts of the lockdown imposed
in countries due to COVID-19 is discussed in the fourth section. In the
last section, conclusion about the study has been provided.
2. Methodology
COVID-19 case data of the countries considered were collected from
www.worldometer.com [6]. A total number of 3726797 million confirmed active COVID-19 cases have been documented worldwide as of
May 5, 2020. The number of approved active COVID-19 cases in
countries considered for this study was recorded as 1440776 as of May
5, 2020. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49
countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates
(without interruption). The lockdown days of the countries were obtained from the websites of the official institutions of each country.
The correlation test was used to analyze the associations between
lockdown days factor and total cases of COVID-19 by countries. The
correlation of the lockdown on the number of COVID-19 cases was
calculated as unconstrained (normal) and unconstrained (Tukeylambda distribution) in two ways. The distribution of Tukey-Lambda
has the shape parameter λ. The Tukey-Lambda distribution is created
with a position parameter, μ and a scale parameter, σ. This is because
the general form of probability functions is expressed in terms of
standard normal distribution. Values less than this mean (0.14) a
heavy-tailed distribution (−1 is close to a Approx. Cauchy). That is, as
the optimal value of λ increases from 0.14 to −1, progressively heavy
tails are implied. Similarly, as the optimal value of λ becomes greater
than 0.14, shorter tails are implied. The Tukey-lambda distribution is
expressed mathematically in Eq. (1).

Fig. 1 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases by 49 countries.
Most of the countries considered are located in the European region
including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain. Although COVID appeared in 19 China, the
European region has become the epicenter of the virus, and more cases
have emerged in Europe than in China. The highest case of COVID-19
from selected countries occurred in Spain, 250561 COVID-19 cases on
May 5, 2020. Italy announced its first approved COVID-19 case on
January 31, 2020.The country with the lowest COVID-19 case is
Paraguay, 461 COVID-19 cases on May 5, 2020.
Fig. 2 shows the days of lockdown imposed by 49 countries. Some of
these countries continue the lockdown. However, the last day of lockdown in these countries was accepted as 5 May 2020 for this study. The
Ireland, which has been curfewed for 68 days, has the longest lockdown
period. A total of 21983 COVID-19 cases were approved as of May 5,
2020 in Ireland. Spain, the country with the highest number of cases,
has been imposed lockdown for 53 days (see Fig. 3).
Although China became the center in the first days of the epidemic,
Italy passed China with the emerging cases. Even though Italy suffered
a severe injury in this pandemic, Italy have managed to control the
number of COVID-19 cases with the lockdown for a long time. On the
other hand, although there is a downward trend in new cases confirmed
in France and Spain, the number of cases confirmed in Spain has exceeded the number of cases confirmed in Italy.
Descriptive analyses were implemented for all the data. The statistical test was two-sided, and a value p < 0.05 was measured for model
and parameter statistically significant based on the fit regression model.
The data used for the study were analyzed using JMP Pro software
(version 15.0), Numbers and Minitab 18.0 statistical computer program.
3. Results and discussions
Descriptive analyses were presented for all the data used in this
study in Table 1. The results of the descriptive analyses were prompted
as 95% confidence intervals for upper and lower mean in lockdown
days and total cases of COVID-19. The statistical test was two-sided, and
a value p < 0.05 was measured for model and parameter statistically
significant.
The data set used is not suitable for normal distribution according to
Anderson-Darling (the value of AD was 9.376 and p-value of AndersonDarling test was 0.0003) and Shapiro-Wilk (the value of W was 0.728
and p-value of Shapiro-Wilk test was 0.010) normality tests. Statistical
processes were performed by transforming COVID-19 data. The transformed COVID-19 data using full Box-Cox transformation method

and +1. The correlation value of a factor indicates that it has a negative
relationship as it approaches −1, and a positive relationship as it approaches +1. The lockdown has been found to have a very strong
correlation on approved COVID-19 cases. The unconstrained correlation value was calculated as −0.9126. Fig. 4 shows the Tukey-Lambda
correlation curve for normality test.
The Tukey-Lambda distribution forms a distribution family that can
approach the normal distribution. The maximum correlation of lockdown and COVID 19 case numbers occurred for the λ value of 0.14
(r = 0.7402), and COVID-19 data was modeled according to a normal
distribution (see Table 2).
The period of lockdown applied by 49 countries on average have
taken 35.38 days. A lockdown was imposed for a minimum of 3 days
while a lockdown was imposed for a maximum of 68 days by countries.
During this period, an average of 29403 people in these countries were
actively infected with COVID-19 virus. The number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases was recorded as a minimum of 431 and a maximum of
250561. Predictive statistics of COVID-19 data and lockdown of the
mentioned countries are given in Table 3. A minimum of 30

40observations are required to create an effective statistical analysis. In
this study, 49 data were used to calculate the lockdown in the aforementioned countries in the spread of COVID-19 pandemic with 95%
relative confidence intervals (t-ratio = −0.83; F ratio = 5.7639;
prob = 0.0413; adjusted R2 = 0.7212). It has been observed that the
developed model was found important according to the statistical
analyses. The lockdown parameter is significant at p < .05, so the data
is very close to zero at 95.0% confidence level (t-ratio = 2.40; F
ratio = 6.1614; prob = 0.0203).
The healthcare system capacities of countries have serious concerns
about meeting the needs of infected COVID-19 patients. Therefore,
countries have to take the strictest measures necessary to slow down or
even stop this pandemic. Otherwise, this situation triggers the intensive
care units to be at their maximum level in these countries. Although the
number of infected patients is very high in Spain and Italy, the number
of cases decreased significantly in recent days. This situation is also
found in other countries. As a result of the strict measures taken, governments plan to return normal life gradually in the countries mentioned. As a result, an absolute decrease in the number of cases will
occur if there is no possibility of virus mutation.
4. Effects of lockdown
4.1. Psychological effects
It is observed that there is a confusion with the rapid spread of the
COVID-19 outbreak in the world and the emergence of serious consequences. For this reason, it is certain that the new data for COVID-19
mental health effects will be obtained more clearly with the big data to
be obtained. According to the first findings obtained in the studies,
Lockdown has been shown to be related to human psychology. It was
determined that stress (8.0%) and depression (16.0–28.0%) were psychological reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings
have some limitations. These psychological symptoms emerged from
only a few of the affected countries and may not reflect the experiences
of people living in other parts of the world. As a result, it is clear that
having confirmed cases and mortality rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on mental health problems.
4.2. Environmental effects
The effect of the lockdown on the environment due to Covid-19 has
been addressed in many studies. It is observed that the environment has
started to renew itself due to all kinds of industry, vehicle movement
and social activities of people continue at a low level for a long time. In
particular, a positive effect of lockdown restrictions on air and water
quality has been observed. Yunus et al. have quantitatively determined
that the quality of the water of Venbanad Lake has increased approximately 15.6% in India with the remote sensing imaging method [12].
Kerimray et al. have analyzed the effect of the 27-day lockdown in the
city of Almaty, Kazakhstan on the concentrations of air pollutants, and
emphasized the increase of air quality in Almaty [13]. Another study
has showed that the quality of air due to the lockdown in Delhi has a
positive effect [14]. Dantas et al. have calculated the CO emission level
as approximately 30.3–48.5% due to the lockdown in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil [15]. For this study, we emphasized that the effect of lockdown

impacts of the indirect lockdown due to Covid-19 were provided.
4.3. Economic effects
The COVID-19 outbreak, which is now turning into a pandemic, is a
global health crisis. However, the measures taken by countries against
this epidemic bring along an unprecedented economic disaster [16].
The global pandemic, namely COVID-19, has been dealt with in many
studies on the socio-economic effects of the world economy [17]. In
almost 90% of the world, social isolation is applied in some way, people
do not go out on the streets, workplaces are closed, flights are banned,
people are dismissed. In terms of the extent of destruction in the
economy during the pandemic and the speed of the expected recovery
after the pandemic; at what level and when the outbreak will be
brought under control, how long the current social distance/isolationoriented measures will be loosened and when it will begin to normalize
in the expansionary economic measures already taken.
5. The limitations of the study
There are some limitations of this study to measure the effect of
Lockdown on COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing
so statistical analysis should continue. There are conflicting statements
regarding lockdown by countries on COVID-19. In countries where the
COVID-19 case is intensely occurring, either no lockdown is imposed or
is applied intermittently. In addition, it is claimed that, besides the
positive aspects of the lockdown, people who comply with this restriction cause a weakened immune system. The main reason for this is
that there is too much food consumption and limited mobility. The
effect of the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on human
health may be the subject of future work.
6. Conclusion
COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide
lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze
the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in 49 countries. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can
be suppressed by a lockdown. In addition, other parameters such as
demographic of population, density of populations, the parameters of
weather, economy, infrastructure of healthcare systems may be considered in the studies considering that it may be effective on COVID-19
pandemic. As a result, the application of lockdown by governments is
also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy
with it being effective on COVID-19.

COVID-19 in context: Why do people die in
emergencies? It’s probably not because of
collective psychology

Notions of psychological frailty have been at the forefront of debates around the public
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, there is the argument that collective
selfishness, thoughtless behaviour, and over-reaction would make the effects of COVID19 much worse. The same kinds of claims have been made in relation to other kinds of
emergencies, such as fires, earthquakes, and sinking ships. We argue that in these cases as
well as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, other factors are better explanations for
fatalities – namely under-reaction to threat, systemic or structural factors, and
mismanagement. Psychologizing disasters serves to distract from the real causes and
thus from who might be held responsible. Far from being the problem, collective
behaviour in emergencies – including the solidarity and cooperation so commonly
witnessed among survivors – is the solution, one that should be harnessed more
effectively in policy and practice.
Notions of psychological frailty – weaknesses of reason or weaknesses of morality – have
been evident in many of the comments on public responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Some
of these have informed policy. For example, part of the reason for delay in introducing
stricter distancing measures in the United Kingdom was the authorities’ assumption that
the public would soon ‘fatigue’ and stop observing them.1 As ever, though, such frailty is
said to be magnified by the collective. Thus, back in the early days of COVID-19, many
commentators argued that collective ‘panic’ would potentially be more disastrous than
the pandemic itself, through its effects on markets, availability of goods,2 relations
between different groups,3 and crime.4 ‘Panic’ – meaning selfish, thoughtless behaviour,
and over-reaction – was said to be as ‘contagious’ as the virus itself.5 Such collective
psychology would therefore turn an emergency into a disaster
But is this really the case? Exactly the same claim about the role of public ‘panic’ has
historically been made in relation to many other kinds of emergencies, including fires,
terrorist attacks, sinking ships, and crowd crushes. Was it really selfishness, over-reaction,
and general bad behaviour that caused so many deaths in these cases? Or was it something
else?
Take the sinking of the M/V Estonia in 1994, for example. Over 800 people died. Prima
facie, the greater survival rates of men over women and crew over passengers might
suggest that the strongest individuals selfishly neglected others in order to save
themselves. But analysis of the survivorship records and eyewitness testimonies illustrates
the danger of psychologizing physical constraints (Cornwell et al., 2001). The extreme
listing of the ship was very sudden. There were attempts among passengers to help each
other, but most did not have the strength to get to the exits themselves, let alone assist
others.
Examining the evidence in emergencies suggests three main reasons why there are
avoidable fatalities: (1) under-reaction to threat, (2) systemic factors, and (3) mismanagement. Here, we briefly describe these alternative explanations for deaths in disasters. We
then examine how far they help us understand what has happened in the case of COVID19 in the UK context, before discussing the real collective psychology of emergencies.
Why did they die?
Rather than over-reaction, the first factor that turns an emergency into a disaster is underreaction. People often underestimate risk and disregard possible signals of danger
(Tierney, Lindell, & Perry, 2001). During 9/11, people inside the World Trade Center who
saw objects falling from the sky outside did not initially recognize these as pieces of the
plane that had struck their building. Slowness to comprehend the threat means delay in
attempts to escape. Some people even took time to close down their computers before
they sought to leave the building.
The second reason for deaths in emergencies is systemic. Disasters do not affect
everyone in the same way; those already disadvantaged suffer disproportionately.6 In the
Grenfell Tower fire – the worst fire in the United Kingdom since the second world war –
neglect and cost-saving by the authorities and manufacturers were behind the fatal
decision to clad the block in flammable material. Poorer sections of society also have fewer
resources to help them cope when disaster strikes and less power to demand adequate
aftercare.
A third reason why emergencies often end so badly is mismanagement. The Cocoanut
Grove nightclub fire of 1942, in which 492 people died, has been presented in psychology
textbooks as an embodiment of the received wisdom that ‘most deaths in night-club fires
are due to crowd panic’. Chertkoff and Kushigian’s (1999) detailed re-analysis of events
suggests instead failure of management of two types. First, there was mismanagement of
space. The emergency exit door was locked. The windows were also nailed shut to
prevent people leaving without paying their tab. Second, there were failures of
communication. There were no exit signs or training in emergency evacuation, so when
staff tried to help lead survivors out, they could not find the fire exit. In the official
investigation, the major causes of the loss of life were said to be the locked doors, the
unfamiliarity and inaccessibility of normal exits, and the jamming of the revolving door
There was no implication that crowd behaviour caused the deaths. The management was
subsequently prosecuted for manslaughter and neglect of building laws.
A similar story of mismanagement of space can be found in the literature on fatal crowd
crushes (sometimes – usually erroneously – called ‘stampedes’). ‘Panic’ explanations
once dominated, but a recent systematic review cites as the most common causes of
fatalities not collective psychology but overcrowding, closure of exits, congestion at
bottlenecks, deficiencies in safety barriers, and lack of coordination with local authorities
(de Almeida & von Schreeb, 2019). Notoriously, the fatal crush at Hillsborough in 1989
was initially explained by some in terms of the disorderly behaviour of fans. But it was later
demonstrated that disproportionate concern among authorities with preventing football
hooliganism led to neglect of crowd safety – including the disastrous decision to let fans
into an already overcrowded terrace.7 In short, Hillsborough, like Cocoanut Grove, did
not happen because of failings at the level of collective psychology.
In relation to failures of communication, changes to information and communication
practices have often improved safety and saved lives. When the World Trade Center was
subject to a terrorist attack in 1993, the evacuation was relatively slow (Aguirre, Wenger,
& Vigo, 1998). Subsequently, regular drills were introduced so that people became
familiar with the locations of emergency exits. This measure helped make the 9/11
evacuation so successful.8 In the case of mass casualty decontamination following a
chemical incident, failure of responders to communicate effectively has led to reduced
public compliance with the procedure, increasing risk of fatalities (Carter et al., 2015).
The solution has been to train responders with the skills to communicate to the public
both why decontamination is needed and how to carry it out (Drury et al., 2019).
Under-reaction, system, and mismanagement in the COVID-19 response
in the United Kingdom
Unlike fires, earthquakes, floods, and bombings, which tend to be short-term events
which occur in one place, the effects of the current pandemic are dispersed in time and
space. Yet like these other emergencies, there is a mortal threat which creates collective
fear. And when we examine some of the major problems in response and outcomes9 in the
COVID-19 crisis, prima facie our three-fold classification above fits better than
explanations in terms of public selfishness, thoughtlessness, and over-reaction.
First, under-reaction:While some members of the public have not taken the pandemic
seriously, the UK data show that the vast majority adhered to the social distancing and ‘stay
at home’ regulations.10 Yet there is evidence of highly consequential political underreaction. In the United Kingdom, a criticism has been that that the government did not
prepare or respond in time.11 Importantly, the official advice on social distancing was only
given on 16 March 2020, and the instruction to ‘stay at home’ only on the 23rd. The result
of this under-reaction is a death rate proportionately higher than most other countries 
with over 30,000 hospital and community deaths recorded by 12 May 2020 (Scally,
Jacobson, & Abbasi, 2020).
Some of this failure to prepare in time may be straightforward mismanagement. But
some of it may also be due to under-estimating risk by those in authority. The World Health
Organization warned about the risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 as early
as 10 January 2020 and urged precautions. The first Department of Health and Social Care
press release on COVID-19, on 22 January, stated that the risk to the UK population was
‘low’.12 Two days later, the Lancet published the first article showing evidence that
COVID-19 was transmittable to humans; the authors recommended careful surveillance,
rigorous testing, respirators, and greater use of personal protective equipment.13 But on
the same day, the UK Chief Medical Officer still maintained that the risk to the UK public
was low. The first documented transmission within the United Kingdom (as opposed to
from travellers from abroad) appeared on 28 February. Yet the UK risk level was not raised
to ‘high’ till 12 March.
In relation to our second factor, one example where systemic factors were evident but
a discourse of public bad behaviour was mobilized was in the case of so-called ‘panic
buying’.14 The rapid emptying of supermarket shelves was an effect of the vulnerability of
just-in-time supply chains to just a small uptick in consumer spending; and purchasing
evidence suggests that, in fact, only a small proportion of the population was stockpiling
in response to the expectations of ‘lockdown’ and shortages.15 Nevertheless, government
ministers chided some of the public for their ‘selfishness’, psychologizing the problem.
This representation of the public as selfish is highly consequential. Where others in the
community are seen as competitors, this can create the very individualism that is being
condemned, undermining the sense of collectivity needed in these times (van Bavel et al.,
2020).
Systemic factors have been crucial in another sense. Poorer and less powerful sections
of society had fewer choices about how to behave during the first phase of lockdown.
Despite media campaigns to vilify some people as selfish and thoughtless ‘covidiots’, the
evidence on reasons for non-adherence shows that much of it was practical rather than
psychological. Many people had to cram into Tube trains to go to work because they
needed money to survive and government support schemes were insufficient. People
were told they could go out to exercise, but those in urban areas had limited public space.
And some employers failed to provide the support for social distancing and hygiene.16
Those with less income and wealth also live in more crowded homes.17
The outcomes of these systematic inequalities are predictable: Poorer people have
repeatedly been shown to be more vulnerable to infection and more likely to die.18 These
inequalities have persisted into the second phase of lockdown (from May 2020), with
lower income people being less able to work from home and more likely to be in jobs that
bring them into contact with others
Finally, there is evidence of a specific mismanagement in the form of failure of
communication. In the UK response, one thing we observed to have changed (and which
might therefore indicate recognition of an earlier error) was the way the public were
addressed in the official messaging. Initial government communications stressed the risk
to oneself as an individual. For example:
As per the current advice, the most important thing individuals can do to protect themselves
remains washing their hands more often, for at least 20 seconds, with soap and water.19
(emphasis added)
The message some people therefore picked up from this was about the risk to
themselves personally. Such individual-focused messaging can lead people to discount the
risk, especially if they consider themselves young and healthy.20 Later, there was a shift to
the rationale being to ‘protect the NHS’, ‘protect others’, and a change from ‘you the
potential victim’ to ‘you the spreader’ (e.g., ‘act like you’ve got it’), which seems to have
been more persuasive.21
The role of collective psychology
This last example makes the point that indeed psychology is heavily involved in the public
response to COVID-19. However, it is not a psychology of fixed behavioural tendencies,
since the self and hence ‘self-interest’ (the motivations for and boundaries of concern)
varies with contextual factors (in this case political leadership, which failed initially to
communicate in collectivist terms). So, of course psychology matters in what happens in
emergencies, but for reasons other than inevitable collective selfishness, thoughtlessness,
and over-reaction.
Let’s consider first the conditions under which behaviour is competitive vs
cooperative in emergencies. There have been many reports of mutual social support by
members of the public during the COVID-19 crisis.22 Reviews suggest that cooperation
among survivors is very common in emergencies and that members of the public save
more lives than professional responders (Drury et al., 2019). But, in some emergencies,
people compete, push, and even trample each other. What are the conditions for this to
occur? Chertkoff and Kushigian’s (1999) comparison of different evacuations found that
there was more competition when exits were narrow and unfamiliar. We also know that
people compete more and coordinate less in evacuations when they are positioned
psychologically as individuals rather than as group members. As Mintz (1951) shows,
when an evacuating crowd blocks the exit, this can be explained in terms of the
prevalence of individual competition in a collective setting (rather than in terms of
excessive emotion). In these cases, then, the emergency ends badly due to the absence of
collective psychology (i.e., lack of coordination and cooperation).

Cooperating and giving support can also carry risks, which need to be acknowledged.
In mass evacuations, the larger the group, the slower the egress, because speed is reduced
through people interacting with each other (Aguirre et al., 1998). And the motivation to
give support to other survivors can lead some to take risks with their personal safety; so,
what is good for the collective in emergency is not always good for particular individuals
(Drury, Cocking, & Reicher, 2009).23 In the case of COVID-19, the risk to the individual
from supporting the group is clear where that supportive behaviour involves physical
proximity (whether delivering food or giving emotional support face-to-face).
What about public under-reaction – why does this occur? Under-estimation of risk has
sometimes been characterized as an ‘optimistic bias’ (Kinsey, Gwynne, Kuligowski, &
Kinateder, 2019). But in a context where emergency events are rare (i.e., most of the
time), it is reasonable to assume that ‘it won’t happen to us’. This assumption can reverse
when emergency events become more common – for example, in 2017 after a spate of
terrorist attacks in London, hundreds of people in Oxford Street fled from a noise that
turned out to be harmless. In general, then, the extent to which information concerning a
threat is seen as plausible is a function of the broad social context of dangers. Expectations
of danger are raised (and the readiness to flee or take other action is greater) in a context of
recent incidents relevant to our social group.
How do perceptions of risk become collective? People respond not only to ‘direct’
signals of risk but to other people’s responses to that signal (Bruder, Fischer, & Manstead,
2014). We suggest that the extent to which the response of others to the possible threat is
seen as conveying information is dependent on the self-relevance of these others in a
particular context, which in turn is often a function of shared identity. Based on what we
know about social influence processes in other contexts (Bruder et al., 2014), in the case
of COVID-19, it is plausible to suppose that the sight of others in our community routinely
observing (or ignoring) social distancing regulations, for example, is likely to send a strong
signal to us around the safety of doing the same – particularly where we identify with the
community or see these exemplars as prototypes.
Psychological factors can interact with management failures to help explain why some
emergency events end so badly. Fearing public ‘panic’ leads the authorities to withhold
information about the emergency (Drury et al., 2019). But lack of information in an
emergency increases public anxiety. And when the public perceives that information is
being withheld from them, this damages their relationship with the authority (Carter
et al., 2015). Consequently, when the authorities do release correct information, the
public may mistrust and fail to act upon it. In the case of COVID-19, the need to treat the
public with respect in order to build trust has been part of the advice given by behavioural
scientists to the UK government.24
Discussion and conclusions
We do not deny that in emergencies some people behave selfishly and thoughtlessly or
that some may over-react. Indeed, as explained, research suggests some of the conditions
for competition to prevail over cooperation. What we are questioning here is the notion
that such public reactions are a default or are a major cause of problems in the COVID-19
crisis. The existing literature on disasters does not support this view, and prima facie
major problems in the COVID-19 response and outcomes can be better understood
otherwise – in terms of (political) under-reaction, systemic issues, and mismanagement.
Collective ‘panic’ is referred to as a ‘disaster myth’ in the literature on disasters (Drury
et al., 2019). Rather than a neutral description of how people actually behave, it is best
understood as part of a particular discourse or cultural representation, one which
psychologizes – and indeed pathologizes – public responses in emergencies and disasters.
Given what is known about under-reaction, systemic factors, and mismanagement in
emergencies, to emphasize instead the role of collective ‘bad behaviour’ has clear
ideological functions. In naturalizing fatalities, it distracts from the real causes and thus
from who might be held responsible for mismanagement, instead blaming the victims.
The irony, of course, is that, far from being the problem, collective psychology in
emergencies – the solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among community
members and strangers – is usually the solution. Collective psychology therefore can and
should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice in the COVID-19 response
(Elcheroth & Drury, 2020) – through framing both the threat and the solution in collective
terms, and through emphasizing shared norms around collective well-being and safety
(Drury et al., 2019). Why do people die in emergencies? It is probably not because of
collective psychology

Psychology and COVID-19: impacts, 
themes and way forward
Anthony L Pillay1,2 and Brendon R Barnes3
Abstract
COVID-19 has brought a new set of challenges at a time when poorer nations were struggling 
with existing burdens. However, the lockdown restrictions aimed at slowing the infection rate 
has created problems of their own such as increased unemployment, poverty, and mental health 
problems. While the lockdown approach may be effective for public health, there is concern 
about the way it is formulated, the empirical basis of some restrictions, and societal impacts. 
There is additional concern that COVID-19 and associated restrictions disproportionately affect 
marginalised groups. As a discipline primarily concerned with human behaviour, Psychology has 
much to contribute to addressing the pandemic.
Keywords
COVID-19, mental health, poverty, psychology, race, women
A host of new words emerged in 2020, some that we never previously contemplated and others that 
we knew, but hardly thought we would need in our lifetime. Terms and phrases such as lockdown, 
self-isolation, social distancing, flatten the curve, herd immunity, and new-normal are used daily, 
and some are recent inclusions in the Oxford English Dictionary (2020). We have conversations 
that include abbreviations like PPE (personal protective equipment), WFH (working from home) 
and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Of course, we are referring 
to the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused untold havoc and forced us to develop our knowledge 
of the disease, regardless of our profession or occupation. Knowledge about the virus quickly 
became essential for health professionals and the public. Because treatment was not an option at 
the time of writing, prevention became the order of the day, with the main approach being a host of 
behaviour change strategies.
Coincidentally, it is one century ago that the world began picking up the pieces after the Spanish 
flu, caused by an H1N1 virus, which infected about 500 million and killed in excess of 50 million 

across the globe (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). About one-third of the world’s 
population was infected between 1918 and 1919, and that was in an era when transnational and 
transcontinental travel was relatively infrequent. Other pandemics of the 20th century include the 
Asian flu in 1957 that killed an estimated 2 million people worldwide, and the Hong Kong flu that 
killed about 1 million people after it took hold in 1968 (Mackenzie, 2005).
COVID-19 has had a profound effect on our thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Understandably, 
it has generated much fear and panic globally. Mental health correlates to the pandemic have been 
widespread and varied in presentation, related to vulnerability and premorbid functioning, with 
social and economic factors contributing heavily. Commenting on national survey data during 
COVID-19, the United Nations (2020) raised concern after studies showed distress prevalence 
ranging from 35% to 60%. A recent population-based survey found that 54% of South Africans 
viewed themselves as moderate to high risk for contracting the virus, suggesting some level of 
anxiety about their current situation (Human Sciences Research Council, 2020). Another community survey of over 12,000 respondents noted significant negative emotions including 33% of 
adults depressed and 45% fearful, with fear, stress, and depression more prevalent in those under 
40 years of age than older persons (Orkin et al., 2020). More worrying, however, is that the 
increased mental health service needs are surfacing during a time of reduced mental health service 
provision due to the risks associated with in-person consultations. In attempts to limit the spread of 
infection, large numbers of mental health service providers have opted to offer telehealth and virtual consultations. The extent to which this mode of consultation is meeting the needs of all concerned in the current situation is yet to be determined, considering the diversity of those in need, 
especially in terms of age, educational level, technological sophistication, financial resources and 
numerous other variables – all an indication of just how egalitarian the virus is.
The mental health problems evident globally, however, are not all due directly to COVID-19. In 
some cases there is severe anxiety about being infected, obsession with prevention behaviours, and 
possible neuropsychiatric sequelae to the infection itself (Troyer et al., 2020). On the other hand, 
many of the mental health effects can be considered iatrogenic, being caused by interventions 
aimed at curbing a health problem. The lockdown, which was instituted in many countries to delay 
transmission in order to avoid overwhelming the health care system, has been imposed strictly in 
countries that opted for such an approach. All citizens were restricted to their homes, with educational facilities and all sectors of employment closed, except for essential services. The ‘stay home’ 
and ‘social distancing’ orders may have been tolerated initially but, having continued for several 
weeks and even months, it has had psychological effects to varying degrees with increased prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (United Nations, 2020). A recent review in the Lancet
on the psychological effects of quarantine noted symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anger, confusion, with some studies linking longer quarantine duration with greater distress, while food and 
water shortages were frequent stressors during quarantine (Brooks et al., 2020). It has been suggested that in instituting the COVID-19 lockdown on much of the global community ‘we are conducting arguably the largest psychological experiment ever’, that while authorities are setting up 
field hospitals to treat the disease there is a concomitant failure to set up the psychological care 
resources that will be needed, and that we will pay the price later (Van Hoof, 2020).
Included here are the major psychological and social consequences of loss of employment and 
the broader economic crisis caused by the lockdown. As history has shown, alcohol and other substances are often used as a way of coping in times of distress. However, the ban on the sale of 
alcohol and tobacco products in South Africa has created much anger and frustration, with looting 
of liquor stores and also legal action threats by liquor sales groups arguing that the ban is unreasonable and unconstitutional (Mlamla, 2020). There were also frustrating restrictions that seem to 
have very little to do with prevention (e.g., not being allowed to buy open toed shoes or a short 150 South African Journal of Psychology 50(2)
sleeved top unless of a knitted fabric) and in some, instances, may work against prevention, for 
example, crowding during restricted exercise times allocated for public spaces.
An extended lockdown, as has been the case in many countries, has also led to distrust about its 
effectiveness. Critics have argued that lockdowns will not achieve the desired impact on infections 
in high-density areas because the interventions are simply not possible. This is especially true for 
poorer countries and those on the South American, African, and Asian continents. For example, 
how do people practice social distancing in crowded living conditions? How do people practice 
handwashing with limited water? This, together with the extreme force by law enforcement officials mostly directed at the poor and marginalised, has led many to question the overreach of government actions that impede human rights. Governments need to pay particular attention to the 
precarious balance between instituting restrictions that are necessary and which will achieve the 
goal of reducing the infection rate, while not treading on the basic rights of its citizens.
Interestingly, researchers from the Oxford Group found that, relative to the severity of outbreak, 
poorer nations imposed more severe lockdown measures than wealthy nations (Gibney, 2020). 
Perhaps an unexpected finding, but whether this approach is advantageous is yet to be determined. 
The phenomenon could reflect on the health resource inadequacies in poorer countries and a resultant panic about whether they will cope with a pandemic, hence their haste towards a cautious 
approach. Adopting an early, robust planning strategy is not to be derided. However, in the face of 
some of the restrictive measures that appear so arbitrary, one cannot but question their validity and 
scientific basis. It leads inevitably to concerns about the extent of social control that governments 
have been known to use in other contexts, like curbing dissenting political views (Wheat, 2019) 
and restricting freedom of speech. Such overreach is destined to evoke severe reactions and serves 
to alienate the populace from its leaders at a time when a unified stance is essential.
What can a critical, responsive, and socially engaged psychology 
offer?
South African psychologists and allies from other disciplines have been active in important ways. 
They have quickly adapted to teaching and practicing psychology virtually. Professional societies 
have lobbied medical aids to support online consultations and teletherapy. They have alerted the 
authorities to the immense mental health burden of lockdown on individuals and on stretched public health practitioners. Some psychologists have been active in the media, conveying valuable 
messaging and information to help the public cope with the stresses of the lockdown and anxieties 
related to the disease. They have enhanced help facilities for people struggling with mental health 
issues and gender-based violence. Psychologists have highlighted how behavioural sciences can 
help frame public health interventions (Tomlinson & Young, 2020). Many have been actively 
involved in local and international research projects to understand the psychological impacts and 
determinants of health-related behaviour. These efforts should be commended.
Importantly, scholars have pointed out the uneven impacts (both of the disease and lockdown) 
of COVID-19 on the marginalised, for example, unemployed or low-income earners, women, 
migrants, disabled communities, LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex) communities, and those in abusive relationships. COVID-19, like previous crises, has highlighted longstanding social fractures such as poverty, inequality, xenophobia, racism, patriarchy, ableism, and 
unequal health care access. For example, of concern has been the significant racial disparity in the 
way the virus has affected communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) 
noted that the disproportionate over-representation of African, Hispanic, and Latino Americans 
among those becoming severely ill and dying relates to a number of factors that make them more 
vulnerable, including living conditions, work circumstances, underlying or comorbid health Pillay and Barnes 151
problems, and inadequate health service access. In South Africa, race and class have historically 
been associated with food insecurities, inadequate housing and poor health care access, among 
other disparities. However, even in the post-apartheid era, factors such as race and socioeconomic 
status dictate health access, with Black Africans, the poor and rural communities having most difficulty (Harris et al., 2011). With South Africa being one of the world’s most unequal societies, a 
large portion of its people are extremely poor, dependent on social grants and informal sector 
employment, and the lockdown effects have been overwhelming (Orkin et al., 2020).
The impact on women, particularly poor women, cannot be ignored. The impact of unemployment on poor Black women (already the highest unemployed) is likely to be severe. Women, across 
class strata, experience increased domestic and child care burdens as well as increases in domestic 
violence. Reports of gender-based violence and domestic abuse to the police in the first 2months 
since the lockdown began numbered 1426 in the Gauteng province of South Africa, meaning the 
actual prevalence is much higher given that many women do not report violence and abuse (Seleka, 
2020). As a result of increased domestic and other demands, employed women have also reported 
lower productivity compared to men during lockdown. For example, publication productivity has 
been significantly lower for women academics compared with men (Fazarkerley, 2020). The added 
pressures that accompany the lockdown restrictions have been significant, with schools closed, but 
also child-minders and domestic helpers have been prohibited from working. The latter scenario 
plays out a further economic disaster because domestic workers in South Africa are mainly poor 
women who rely heavily on this source of income. Private households have been known to provide 
around 1.3 million such jobs (Statistics South Africa, 2018), and by the time of this publication, the 
majority have been without work for over 2months. The recent survey by Orkin et al. (2020) noted 
significant mental health impact on women during this period, with feelings of depression and 
apprehension reported by 36% and 50%, respectively. That study also highlighted hunger as the 
most significant predictor of overall psychological distress, revealing that those who are hungry 
experience 9% more sadness, 12% more anger, 15% more stress, and 17% more depression than 
those who are not hungry.
Lockdown has also had severe impacts on LGBTI people. There have been reports of increased 
stigmatisation, discrimination, and violence against this group (Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, 2020). In Peru, for example, the government has allowed men 
and women out on alternative days with no accommodation for transgender people leading to stigmatisation (Perez-Brumer & Silva-Santisteban, 2020). Similarly, the lockdown has had profound 
impacts on migrants who are in precarious positions due to unstable work, xenophobic attitudes, 
lack of access to services (e.g., health care), susceptibility to unscrupulous law enforcement practices, and mobility restrictions. The mental and physical impacts on people with disabilities are 
particularly acute and are deserving of attention (McKinney et al., 2020).
In addition, scholars have long cautioned us about the political consequences of health behaviour change (Barnes, 2015). Health behaviour change tends to place the blame and remedy for 
COVID-19 on the marginalised. Becket (2020) writes about how in the United States, the COVID19 discourse has shifted the blame on the unhealthy lifestyles of the marginalised. The argument 
put forward by the US health secretary was that the reason for the high morbidity and mortality was 
because of unhealthy lifestyles and comorbidity such as diabetes among African Americans. Not 
only does this have racist and classist undertones, it ignores structural determinants of COVID-19 
such as poverty, inequality, environmental injustices, poor leadership (in that country in particular), 
and poor health care that governments have failed to address.
It is important for psychologists to continue the important work related to COVID-19 in terms 
of research, teaching, and practice. It is important for organised psychology to continue to draw 
attention to inadequately resourced mental health care systems and to strengthen partnerships 152 South African Journal of Psychology 50(2)
with other sectors, disciplinary allies, and activist organisations. It is important to speak out 
against human rights violations that have been reported in several parts of the world. It is equally 
important to highlight upstream issues that governments around the world, but ours specifically, 
have failed to address. COVID-19, like previous social crises, offers another opportunity for 
psychologists to actively speak up for marginalised groupings in pursuit of a more just and equal 
society.
Psychology, as a behavioural and human science, has much to contribute in shaping and 
reinforcing behavioural interventions and public health strategies in times of pandemics like 
COVID-19. In addition, it is well placed to advise on necessary social policy development especially considering that societal support is essential for governments to effectively manage a 
pandemic. To this end, the South African Journal of Psychology together with the Psychological 
Society of South Africa (PsySSA) and partner publishing outlets, will do everything it can to 
be an avenue for psychological contributions on COVID-19. As a discipline, Psychology has 
witnessed many global challenges including wars, famine, economic crises, fascism, racism, 
and disease – it is vital that we consider carefully what we learn from this pandemic; how the 
world responded; what our failings were; and how we all can think and behave differently in a 
post-COVID-19 world.

This paper discusses the impact of a series of psychological phenomena on the
U.S. response to COVID-19, focusing on forecasts of cases and deaths. The
specific phenomena comprise unrealistic optimism bias, overconfidence, anchoring and
adjustment, representativeness, motivated reasoning, and groupthink.
Keywords: biases, forecasts, deaths, cases, pandemic (COVID-19)
INTRODUCTION
A combination of psychological issues have negatively impacted the manner in which the
United States has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially judgments of future
cases and deaths.
In mid-September 2020, the number of confirmed cases and the number deaths from COVID19 in the United States (U.S.) was the second highest in the world. Confirmed cases exceeded 6
million and total deaths exceeded 200,000. On a per capita basis, the U.S ranked second at 19,958
confirmed cases per million and 592 deaths per million, just behind Brazil. By way of contrast,
China, the country in which the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originated, has experienced just
over 90,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,700 deaths, corresponding, respectively, to 62.7 and
3.3 per million.
The situation in the United States is even starker when contrasted with countries
such as South Korea [approximately 22,500 confirmed cases (439 per million) and 367
deaths (7 per million)] and Taiwan [500 confirmed cases (21 per million) and 21 deaths
(0.294 per million)] which to date rank near the top in best managing the outbreak
of the pandemic.
The reasons why confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 are so high in the United States
are varied and complex. I find it useful to place countries into one of the following four categories:
1. Those that responded aggressively when the virus first presented within their borders,
using testing, tracing, social distancing, hygiene, masks, restrictions on mass gatherings, and
lockdowns1
;
2. Those whose first responses were weak, experienced serious outbreaks, and revised their
responses along the lines followed by countries who had initially reacted strongly2
;

South Korea and Taiwan fall into the first category. Subsequent infection waves have occurred even among countries falling
into the first category.

See Stancati and Pancevski (2020). Italy is an example of a country falling into the second category. Other countries that
so qualify are China, Germany, Spain, and France.

3. Those whose first responses were weak, experienced
serious outbreaks, and delayed revising their responses
along the lines followed by countries who initially reacted
strongly, thereby losing control as the virus continued to
spread within their borders3
; and
4. Those who have not yet experienced serious outbreaks4
.
I suggest that the United States falls into the third category.
There are many reasons for the country’s weak response
that involve differences in ideology about individual liberties
and collective action, regulatory structures, the nature of its
public health system, supply chain issues, and flawed human
judgment5
. These are broad issues, and although I will touch
on some of these in the paper, I focus mostly on the flawed
human judgments made by a small group: the U.S. president,
key members of his coronavirus task force, and the Institute
for Heath Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University
of Washington.
Forecasts by professionals can be important because of their
potential to inform the expectations of the public, and to
influence the decisions of policy makers. Moreover, there is
an important psychological dimension to the manner in which
people generally make predictions. In this paper, I discuss
one facet of how these issues have been manifest in the U.S.
response to COVID-19, by focusing on the presence of optimism
bias (Weinstein, 1980) and overconfidence (Svenson, 1981;
Harvey, 1997; Hoffrage, 2004) in forecasts of confirmed cases
and deaths associated with the pandemic. I also discuss the
impact of additional psychological phenomena that contribute
to optimism bias and overconfidence, namely motivated
reasoning (Kunda, 1990), representativeness (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1973), similarity (Tversky, 1977), anchoring and
adjustment (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974), and groupthink
(Janis, 1972, 1982).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
“Context: Forecasting U.S. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths”
describes the context for the development of projections of cases
and deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. Section “Judgments,
Decisions, Biases, and Psychology” focuses on a series of
psychological issues that appear to have injected biases into these
projections. Section Conclusion concludes.
CONTEXT: FORECASTING U.S.
COVID-19 CASES AND DEATHS
On January 28, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump received
a warning about COVID-19 from national security adviser
Robert O’Brien, who told him: “This will be the biggest national
security threat you face in your presidency. This is going
3The United Kingdom, Sweden, and Brazil fall into this category, and as I suggest
below, so does the United States.
4Up until the end of July, Botswana and Namibia fell into the fourth category. Since
then, confirmed cases and deaths have been increasing.
5During February 2020, the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) experienced a
serious failure in creating a test for COVID-19, which contributed to a major delay
in the country’s ability to detect infection (Leonhardt, 2020; Lipton et al., 2020a).
to be the roughest thing you face” (Woodward, 2020). Just
over a week later, the president provided an implicit, private
conditional estimate of annual U.S. fatalities from COVID-19.
The estimate was a range, between 125,000 and 150,000 deaths,
conditional on China maintaining control of the virus within
its borders6
. As noted above, total fatalities crossed 200,000
in September 2020.
President Trump’s public pronouncements were diametrically
opposed to the views he shared privately with Woodward. In
mid-February, the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. was
15, with all cases having a direct link to China, the source of
the outbreak. At that time, the President remarked: “The 15
within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero”
(Watkins et al., 2020).
In the third week of February, the number of confirmed cases
began to jump in discrete amounts. U.S. equity market declined
sharply, as investors reduced their estimates downwards, of the
ability of the U.S. to prevent an outbreak in its homeland (Imbert
and Huang, 2020). At the end of February 2020, the number
of confirmed cases had risen to 66, with no deaths yet being
attributed to COVID-19.
During March 2020, some states within the U.S. began to
impose lockdowns and other containment measures to deal with
the outbreak of new cases. In consequence, unemployment rose
sharply, and both the U.S. Congress and Federal Reserve put
anti-cyclical policy measures in place to counteract the negative
shock to the economy. At the same time, the messaging from
the White House, which had established a coronavirus task
force, downplayed the severity of the threat, and emphasized
the importance of avoiding unnecessary containment measures
that would reduce economic activity. In the third week
of March, during a press briefing, the President suggested
that the economy might fully reopen by Easter, just a few
weeks away7
.
During March 2020, confirmed cases rose from 69 to 164,620.
Total U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 rose from 3 to 21,595.
In a press briefing on March 29, 2020 (Whitehouse. gov, 2020)
the President reversed his views about an Easter reopening, and
together with coronavirus task force leaders provided forecast
6
In a February 7 taped telephone conversation with Woodward, President Trump
said the following: “It’s also more deadly than your—you know, your, even your
strenuous flus. You know, people don’t realize, we lose 25,000, 30,000 people a
year here. Who would ever think that, right? Pretty amazing. And then I say, well,
is that the same thing? This is more deadly. This is 5 per—you know, this is 5 vs.
1% and <1%.” The 125,000–130,000 estimates are inferred from the figures given
in this quotation.
7This focus of this paper is on the narrow issue of forecasting bias, and not the
many broad issues relating to problematic judgments and decisions in the U.S.
response to the pandemic. Examples of broader issues include President Trump,
flanked by members of the coronavirus task force, trumpeting a report that lists the
U.S. as being number 1 in respect to the Global Health Security Index, but failing to
acknowledge that the report does so for emergency preparedness only, and points
out that the U.S. ranks poorly in respect to health care access; the White House in
2018 having disbanded its Pandemic Office, and therefore its readiness to deal with
a pandemic; the president firing a deputy inspector general at the Department of
Health and Human Services for identifying severe shortages at hospitals that were
treating COVID-19; the Center for Disease Control failing to produce a timely
test for COVID-19 early on during the pandemic; and the U.S. having a disjointed
public health system that was reliant on outdated technology, which limited its
ability to conduct testing and contact tracing.

ranges for eventual cumulative U.S. deaths from COVID-19. This
particular press briefing was important in three ways.
First, the briefing made clear that the White House accepted
that by not engaging in containment measures, total U.S. deaths
from COVID-19 would likely be near 2.2 million.
Second, the White House estimated that with containment,
total U.S. deaths would likely be between 100,000 and 200,0008
,
although several days later the high end was increased to 240,000
(Bierman and Levey, 2020).
Third, Dr. Deborah Birx, a leading member of the White
House task force addressing the pandemic, stated that her
team had reviewed the work of 12 institutes that had been
forecasting cases and deaths from COVID-19, and pointed people
to the IHME’s website, noting that the IHME estimates were in
line with their own.
In early April, Eichenbaum et al. (2020) presented a
framework that integrated standard models from epidemiology
and economics. The paper analyzed the interrelationship among
containment policy, economic activity, and the trajectory of
cumulative U.S. deaths from COVID-19. The authors examined
several cases, and examined a range of outcomes. Their analysis
suggested that cumulative U.S. deaths from COVID-19 would be
in the range 500,000 to 1.5 million, depending on the strength
of containment policy, that herd immunity would be between
50 and 70% of the population, that herd immunity would be
achieved between 36 and 52 weeks from the onset of the epidemic,
and that full containment of the virus would occur between 75
and 100 weeks after onset. Notably, a weak containment policy
would result in herd immunity being achieved more quickly, but
with more total cases and deaths9
.
For the U.S., April 2020 was an important month, and for
three reasons. First, confirmed cases and deaths associated with
COVID-19 soared and daily rates peaked. At the end of the
first week of the month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, arguably the most
respected member of the White House coronavirus task force,
remarked that the total number of deaths from COVID-19 might
not exceed 60,000 (Chappell, 2020)
10. Third, the White House
established its broad strategy for addressing the outbreak. This
strategy involved limiting the role of the federal government,
delegating responsibility to individual states, providing states
with some measure of resources, and working to encourage the
weakening of containment measures and consequent reopening
of the U.S. economy as quickly as possible. White House
8The transcript from the press briefing quotes Dr. Birx as saying the following:
“So in the model—and there’s a—there’s a large confidence interval, and so it’s
anywhere in the model between 80,000 and 160,000, maybe even potentially
200,000 people succumbing to this. That’s with mitigation. In that model, they
make full assumption that we continue doing exactly what we’re doing, but even
better, in every metro area with a level of intensity. Because we’re hoping that the
models are not completely right; that we can do better than what the predictions
are.”
9Value of life models, such as the one used in Eichenbaum et al. (2020) are
traditionally used by policy makers can be used to evaluate the tradeoff between
COVID-19 infections and deaths on the one hand, and economic activity on the
other. Notably, I can find no evidence to suggest that tradeoff frameworks such as
Eichenbaum et al. (2020) played any major role, or indeed any role at all, in White
House policy decisions related to COVID-19, meaning that policies appear to have
been developed based more on intuition than systematic analysis.

personnel working on the response to COVID-19 used the
term “state authority handoff ” to describe the first part of
the strategy11
.
Although the White House had established a coronavirus task
force, within the White House a small group of aides actually
separately developed policy for dealing with the virus. This group
was headed by the Chief of Staff12. Only one member of the group
was a public health official, and that was Dr. Birx, an expert
in infectious diseases, who had spoken alongside the president
at the March 29 press briefing. According to coverage in the
New York Times13, Dr. Birx “was a constant source of upbeat
news” and provided “charts emphasizing that outbreaks were
gradually easing.” One particular argument she advanced, in
April 2020, was that the U.S. “was likely to resemble Italy, where
virus cases declined steadily from frightening heights.”
Figure 1 contrasts the number of daily deaths per million
from COVID-19 in Italy and in the U.S. between January 1
and September 16, 2020. The left hand portion of Figure 1,
from January 1 through the end of April, provides the trajectory
relevant for Dr. Birx during March and April.
The perspective provided by Dr. Birx provided support
for two White House priorities, namely relaxing containment
measures and shifting responsibility for addressing the pandemic
to the states. With an upcoming Presidential election in
November 2020, the President appears to have been especially
concerned that strong containment measures would continue
to depress economic activity and therefore the likelihood of his
being re-elected.
At the March 29 press briefing, Dr. Birx made clear that the
IHME modeling approach, and estimates of cases and deaths,
were similar to her own. Subsequently, U.S. media focused
attention on the IHME. During April, IHME spokesperson Ali
Mokdad, Chief Strategy Officer and Professor of Global Health
11See Shear et al. (2020). In their article, the authors suggest that the state authority
handoff strategy would serve to shift blame from the president to the states, in the
event that U.S. cases and deaths from COVID-19 surged.
12The Chief of Staff at the time was Mark Meadows.

at the University of Washington, participated in several media
interviews to discuss IHME’s projections (forecasts)14. On April
15, the IHME indicated that according to their model, the
number of new U.S. COVID-19 cases had peaked some days
before. At this time, the number of total confirmed cases reached
609,516 and the number of total deaths had reached 26,922.
On April 15, the IHME was projecting that the eventual
number of U.S. deaths attributable to COVID-19 would be
60,308. This projection was significantly below the low end of
the range provided by the White House, just 2 weeks before,
but in line with a statement made by Dr. Fauci a week before.
Both the IHME’s statements about the peak daily deaths having
been reached, and the lower estimate for total eventual deaths,
provided support for those who favored relaxing containment
measures and reopening the U.S. economy.
To provide a sense of the economic situation at the time,
on April 24, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast
that during the second quarter of 2020 (April–June), U.S. gross
domestic product would shrink by approximately 11% from
the previous quarter (January–March), which corresponded to
an annual rate of 40%15. For most of April, the White House
had communicated its preference for reopening the economy
as soon as possible, and encouraged reopening measures to
take place on May 1.
On April 12, at the time of peak daily deaths, IHME Director
Dr. Christopher Murray publicly warned that reopening the
economy too soon would lead to higher daily deaths16. In an
interview with the New York Times, Dr. Murray noted that on or
about April 22, he detected a change in tone in his conversations
with Dr. Birx, which reflected a serious interest in reopening
the economy imminently17. On May 4, when it became clear
that the reopening was indeed taking place, the IHME raised its
projection for cumulative deaths to 134,475, effectively doubling
its prior point forecast.
Infection rates strongly depend on social distancing behaviors.
According to coverage in the New York Times, the models
Dr. Birx employed in her analysis did not properly account
for the infection-related implications associated with reopening
the economy18. Between May 4 and June 19, new daily cases
ranged between 18,000 and 28,500, in a series of cycles with no
discernable trend. However, thereafter, daily cases began to rise
sharply. Writing for the Washington Post on June 25, Fritz and

video/?471218-1/tracking-spread-covid-19, and a Fox News April 16 interview
on Fox News, https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-ali-mokdad-ihme-revisedmodel.
15This forecast was in line with those made by private economists (Nicholson,
2020). Notably, the CBO also forecast that during the third quarter (July–
September), gross domestic product would grow at an annual rate of 23%, in the
fourth quarter (October–December) by 13%, and in 2021 (January–December) by
3%. In this regard, the CBO assumed that social distancing will be maintained but
at lower levels from those in March and April, through the first half of 2021. The
CBO’s forecasts for growth between July 2020 and December 2021 were higher
than those of academic economists, the latter having predicted a slower recovery
(Baker et al., 2020).

Selk (2020) report the highest single-day caseload, over 38,000,
for the United States, since the outbreak of the pandemic. Within
days, the number of new cases would cross 40,000 (per day)19
and during July would exceed 75,000. Fritz and Selk quote Robert
Redfield, Director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as
having said: “Our best estimate right now is that for every case
that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections20.”
Fritz and Selk write that according to infectious-disease
experts, the increased number of cases reflects a rush to relax
containment measures without having put appropriate safety
measures in place, which they say “sends a dangerous and
inaccurate message”21
.
During the first week of July, Dr. Birx acknowledged that the
U.S. had underestimated community spread of the virus, noting
transmission by young people. A month later, she said that the
epidemic had entered a new phase, as it had moved into rural
areas from urban centers. She was very clear to say that the
situation in early August was distinctly different from what it had
been during the preceding March and April, in that it had become
“extraordinarily widespread22.”
During a public presentation in early August, Dr. Birx
responded to a question about whether the number of U.S.
COVID-19 related deaths would surpass 300,000 by the end
of 2020, a figure suggested by a former commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Birx responded to the
question by saying “anything is possible,” and noted that such
an outcome would be far less likely if Americans practiced
appropriate social distancing and avoided mass gatherings
(Hawkins and Iati, 2020).
Dr. Fauci regularly emphasized the importance of wearing
masks, social distancing, choosing to be outdoors more than
indoors whenever possible, avoiding crowds and washing hands.
He repeated the point in an exchange with Senator Rand Paul,
during an August appearance at a Senate hearing on the nation’s
coronavirus response.
Whereas Dr. Fauci argued that these measures just mentioned
had helped New York’s recover from a major outbreak in April,
Senator Paul held that the recovery reflected herd immunity. Dr.
Fauci responded to the herd immunity assertion by stating that
22%, the COVID-19 infection rate in New York, was far too low
for herd immunity in the case of COVID-19. However, Senator
Paul’s perspective was that other forms of the coronavirus have
already provided immunity to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), perhaps half the population, in which case the combination
would be closer to 70%. By this argument, the U.S. had already
reached herd immunity in August, and the pandemic had already
begun to wind down in the U.S. (Cook, 2020).
Also in August, the president invited Dr. Scott Atlas into his
coronavirus task force and policy group. Dr. Atlas, a radiologist
19During March and April, the vast majority of COVID-19 cases and deaths were
concentrated in New York State and New Jersey. During the summer, cases and
deaths were concentrated in the south and west of the country.
20For sake of tractability, I do not address the undercount issue, and therefore the
analysis I provide can be considered conservative.
21This comment underscores the relevance of possible optimism bias in
professional forecasts of COVID-19 deaths.

and neuroradiologist and fellow of the Hoover Institution,
shared the president’s and Senator Paul’s views about opening
the economy, opening schools, and not wearing masks (Cook,
2020). Dr. Atlas’ perspective sharply differed from eminent
epidemiologists surveyed by McNeil (2020), whose combined
estimates suggest that between 9 and 16% of the U.S. population
had been infected by COVID-19. McNeil notes that the top end of
this range is much less than the 60% infection rates characterizing
areas hard hit by COVID-19, which immunity to coronaviruses
other than SARS-CoV-2 did not prevent.
In retrospect, although the U.S. and Europe experienced
rapidly rising COVID-19 related cases and deaths during the
early months of 2020, by July Europe had managed to reduce
new infections and deaths quite dramatically, while the U.S.
was experiencing an upsurge (Stancati and Pancevski, 2020). In
Europe, new daily confirmed cases peaked at just under 30,000
at the beginning of April, while in the U.S., new daily confirmed
cases peaked at just over 30,000 during the second week of April.
Subsequently, Europe brought down its daily cases to about
5,000 during mid-July23. In contrast, as mentioned above, new
daily cases in the U.S. soared above 70,000. See Figure 2 which
contrasts the number of daily confirmed cases per million for
Italy and the U.S. between January 1 and September 16, 2020.
Keep in mind that, as mentioned above, the head of the Center for
Disease Control had stated that confirmed cases might severely
understate the number of actual infections.
The differences experienced by the U.S. and Europe in July
2020 reflect the different policy decisions made in April 2020;
and there is reason to suspect that those policy decisions reflect
different judgments about the threat from COVID-19, as well as
different preferences about bearing the costs of containment.
Most European governments appeared willing to take
responsibility for coordinating a centralized approach, within
each country, to testing and tracing, in order to detect and
contain emerging clusters of infections. The time series of daily
deaths in Italy displayed in Figure 2 reflect the fact that Italy
23I note that this rate began to increase at the end of July because of reduced social
distancing, mostly by young people.
eventually pursued a focused strategy to reduce its new case rate
sufficiently before reopening its economy, undertook effective
testing and contact tracing, and its population remained vigilant
about social distancing.
In contrast, the U.S. followed a decentralized approach that
was lacking in coordination. In addition, Europeans appear to be
much less concerned about their civil liberties being infringed
because of requirements for wearing masks, whereas in some
portions of the U.S., required mask wearing was viewed as
being highly problematic. In addition, the U.S. has not been
able to execute a sufficiently effective strategy for combining
testing and contact tracing, which becomes more difficult as the
number of cases grows.
JUDGMENTS, DECISIONS, BIASES, AND
PSYCHOLOGY
I suggest that a series of biases, reflecting the influences of
both intentional strategic misrepresentation and unintentional
psychological processes, have characterized key judgments and
decisions about COVID-19 in the U.S. In this section, I focus on
statements, actions, and predictions about the pandemic made
by the following key actors: the president, the leading figures in
the coronavirus task force, and the IHME. I have organized the
section to focus, in turn, on each actor.
The central psychological elements discussed below are
unrealistic optimism and overconfidence (in the sense of
precision), which have occurred in conjunction with motivated
reasoning, elements of groupthink, availability bias, anchoring,
and representativeness24. I place the psychological issues in bold
font, in order to highlight their appearance, and do likewise with
strategic misrepresentation.
The president: The record is clear in respect to the U.S.
president having consistently downplayed the seriousness of
COVID-19, and rejected the advice of the scientific community
on what would constitute an effective response25. In a March 19
call with Woodward (Woodward, 2020), Trump acknowledged:
“I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down
because I don’t want to create a panic.” This statement serves
to reconcile the diametrically opposite nature of the president’s
public pronouncements about the pandemic, which reflected
severely unrealistic optimism bias, and his private views which
in retrospect appeared to display only mild optimism bias.
Game theorists use the term strategic misrepresentation to
mean actors with agency intentionally disseminating information
they know to be untrue, as a means to further their own
private interests (Roth, 2002). The record is clear that the
president engaged in strategic misrepresentation, explaining to
Woodward that his motive for making untruthful statements
about the pandemic was to avoid creating panic. If so, then to
what end?
24References for these issues appear in the introductory section and are not
repeated here. In addition, readers are assumed to be familiar with the terminology.

Shefrin Biased U.S. COVID-19 Forecasts
In an interview with National Public Radio in February,
pandemic expert Laurie Garrett suggested that the president’s
intent was to downplay the dangers from the pandemic in order
to limit damage to the U.S. economy and financial markets, as an
economic downturn would threaten the prospects of his being reelected the following November (National Public Radio, 2020). In
May 2020, Garrett stated that the White House was interfering
with the CDC, limiting its ability to make pronouncements
that reflected the scientific judgments of its staff (Bruni, 2020).
The extent of this intimidation became a major media story in
September 2020 (Weiland, 2020), and in the first week of October
the president, the first lady, and several White House officials
tested positive for COVID-19 (Baker and Haberman, 2020).
To summarize the main points about the president’s
judgments of U.S. deaths from COVID-19: I suggest that
the misrepresentations associated with the president’s public
pronouncements on the pandemic largely reflect an attempt
to induce bias unrealistic optimism bias in a large segment
of the U.S. population, including some public officials. In this
respect, a key driver of optimism bias is desirability (Weinstein,
1980), interpreted as wishful thinking. I also suggest that
motivated reasoning has reinforced optimism bias, by inducing
this segment of the U.S. public to underweight, if not ignore, the
subsequent events of the pandemic that strongly disconfirmed the
perspective inherent in the president’s earlier pronouncements.
The intent of the misrepresentations, I suggest, has been to
foster a political environment that facilitated the relaxation of
containment measures at the end of April in order to reopen
the economy at that time. As I discuss below, doing so appears
to have induced a surge of COVID-19 cases beginning in June
and continuing through the summer and beyond, with messaging
from the White House that consistently downplayed both the
statistics on cases and deaths as well as the views of traditional
medical scientists and epidemiologists. That the president himself
contracted COVID-19 after flouting the need for masks also
appears to be consistent with unrealistic optimism.
IHME: The IHME uses a proprietary statistical forecasting
methodology that makes use of multiple variables. Although the
IHME does not provide details of their forecasting methodology,
they do say that IHME methodology for projecting deaths is
based on models that are different from most other research
groups, because of IHME’s emphasis on fitting the patterns of
daily mortality observed in the experiences of other geographic
areas such as Wuhan, Italy and Spain.
As Dr, Birx stated on March 29, the IHME’s perspective
was similar to her own. She also mentioned that she had
reviewed 12 different models from institutions that included
Imperial College London and Columbia University. Notably, the
Reich Lab at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst tracks
most of these models, and uses them to compile an aggregate
“ensemble” forecast.
Figure 3 displays the IHME projections, published on April
15, 2020, of the cumulative number of U.S. deaths attributable to
COVID-19 for the period April 16 to August 4, 2020. Notice that
there are three projections in the figure: a point forecast along
with a low forecast and high forecast defining a 95% confidence
interval for each forecast date.
FIGURE 3 | For the period February 29 through July 31, 2020, IHME
projection of cumulative deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S., consisting of a
point forecast (totdeath_mean) and the lower bound (totdeath_lower) and
upper bound (totdeath_upper) of a 95% forecast confidence interval. IHME
projection is as of April 15, 2020. Source: www.healthdata.org.
According to the point forecast in Figure 3, the COVID-19
outbreak in the U.S. would have been fully contained by August 4,
at just over 60,000 deaths, with 95% containment being achieved
by May 5. I note that the forecasts of daily deaths, computed
as the first difference of the mean cumulative forecast, was the
lowest among all professional forecasts of COVID-19 deaths
compiled by the Reich Lab, and much lower than the estimates in
Eichenbaum et al. (2020). While most forecasts featured positive
daily deaths after May 5, the IHME daily forecast fell to near
zero after May 5.
Consider whether the forecast(s) displayed in Figure 3 exhibit
unrealistic optimism and overconfidence26. Formally, unrealistic
optimism features the mean forecast of number of deaths
being too low, while overconfidence features the width of the
confidence intervals being too narrow.
To test formally for unrealistic optimism, I compare the
IHME mean cumulative death forecast trajectory with the actual
death series between April 16 and August 4. See Figure 4, which
shows the IHME mean forecast from April 15 lying well below
subsequent actual death totals from COVID-19. A formal t-test
of optimism bias is based on the ratio of the actual series to the
point forecast series. With the null hypothesis being no bias, a
trend regression of the time series for this ratio should feature
an intercept of 1 and a slope coefficient of 0. A trend regression
on the actual series exhibits an intercept of 1.0 and a positive
slope coefficient with a t-statistic of 96. This result supports the
conclusion of unrealistic optimism bias. As can be seen from
Figure 4, the IHME projection of full containment by August 4,
2020 also exhibits unrealistic optimism bias.
To test formally for overconfidence (in the sense of excess
precision), I compare the relative frequency with which actual
deaths lie outside the IHME’s confidence interval between April
26See Shefrin (2020) for a prospective discussion of these IHME projections, rather
than a retrospective discussion.

16 and August 4. Overall, the IHME forecast displays slight
overconfidence with 85.6%, not the required 95%, of actual deaths
lying with the confidence band in Figure 4. However, notice
that the IHME’s projections exhibit underconfidence in the left
portion of the horizon, because the actual series lies completely
within the confidence band, and overconfidence in the right
portion of the horizon, when the actual series moves outside, and
remains outside the confidence band.
After the March 29 White House press briefing, American
media outlets began to pay disproportionate attention to IHME
projections. Professor Mokdar emerged as the chief spokesperson
for IHME. As COVID-related deaths surged in the first half of
April, Professor Mokdar made clear in interviews that IHME was
projecting daily deaths to peak on or about April 12, thereby
suggesting that the worst of the pandemic would soon be over.
Those views were especially appreciated, and communicated by
parties arguing for a rapid reopening of the economy.
I have three points to make about these particular interviews.
First, as far as I can tell, media interviews focused only on
point estimates, not the wide confidence intervals. Indeed, my
impression from viewing several of these videos is that the
confidence with which Dr. Mokdar discussed the point forecasts
did not reflect the width of the IHME confidence intervals. In this
respect, I would characterize the tone of the interview discussions
as consistent with overconfidence (in the sense of precision).
Second, I note that Professor Mokdar stated in interviews
(cited above) that from the first, he and his team have thought
that the total number of deaths would not exceed 100,000. Quite
possibly, the 100,000 figure served as an anchor, in the sense of
anchoring and adjustment bias.
Third, Dr. Mokdar did not just confine himself to describing
IHME projections, but also offered his opinion on reopening the
economy. In this regard, he stated that he thought it was a good
time to begin having discussions about reopening the economy in
a phased way, and that from the outset IHME had been focusing
on both response to the pandemic and recovery. He emphasized
the importance of proceeding with a trial approach, so as to
prevent the virus from resurfacing after a successful lockdown.
He spoke personally about these issues, noting that many of his
friends had lost their jobs or had to close their restaurants.
Because of availability bias, it is plausible that the media’s
attention on IHME led the IHME to exercise disproportionate
influence on the views of the American public relative to other
information sources. For example, Bierman and Levey (2020)
report that based on the IHME projections from early April,
cumulative COVID-19 U.S. deaths might even be less than the
100,000 low end forecast which Dr. Birx had communicated in
the March 29 White House press briefing27
.
In respect to response, recovery, and biases related to
optimism and overconfidence, it is worth noting that on April
12 IHME’s Director Dr. Christopher Murray strongly cautioned
that the IHME projections were conditional on not reopening
the economy too early; and many states began to reopen at the
beginning of May28. On May 4, the IHME sharply revised its
projections upwards, as displayed in Figure 5. I would also point
out that the revised projections were very close to the ensemble
forecast produced by the Reich Lab at this time29
.
The flat portion at the right of Figure 5, meaning the
asymptote, for the mean projection in the revised forecast from
May 4 was 134,475. Notably, Figure 5 shows that optimism bias
disappeared between May 4 and July 430. However, the May 4
forecast was less accurate for the remainder of July as cumulative
deaths climbed above 150,00031. Even the IHME point forecast
of cumulative deaths made on June 27 displayed unrealistic
optimism, being more than 4% too low at the end of July with
forecasted cumulative deaths not crossing 150,000 until August 8.
During July, the IHME began to make its projections
conditional on containment policy. In mid-September, the IHME
offered three projections for January 1, 2021: a high forecast
corresponding to weak containment (“mandates easing”), a low
forecast associated with the universal wearing of masks, and a
27For example, according to a Factiva search, for the 3 months ending May 11,
IHME projections were mentioned in The Wall Street Journal 1,980 times, in
contrast to Imperial College London (542 times) and Columbia University (259
times).
28Before May, the IHME data available on the IHME website did not contain
a variable for social distancing. In June, that variable was subsequently
displayed. Social distancing, as a proxy for overall strength of containment, is
a critical determining variable of the virus transmission rate. Its omission, or
underweighting, might well have produced optimism bias in the April forecasts
of cumulative U.S. deaths made by IHME.
29Several of the forecasts monitored by the Reich Lab at the University of
Massachusetts have consistently overestimated cumulative U.S. deaths from
COVID-19, thereby displaying unrealistic pessimism. The same is true for
the framework developed by Eichenbaum et al. (2020), which integrates a
macroeconomic model and an epidemiology model, incorporating assumptions
about uncertainty in respect to vaccine availability and potential treatments.
30The revised forecast series actually exhibited mild pessimism.
31The revised IHME revised forecast from May 10 is more accurate in predicting
COVID-19 related deaths during July, ending the month at 146,699, a figure
reached on July 26.

current projection lying between the low and the high. As of
September 18, the point forecasts were, respectively, 445,605,
263,484, and 378,320.
In September, McNeil (2020) reports that the IHME estimated
that only 9% of the U.S. population had been infected by
COVID-19 at that time, far less than the percentage required for
herd immunity. As to the untested theory that immunity from
coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to herd
immunity for COVID-19, McNeil quotes Dr. Murray, the IHME’s
head, as saying that this idea is “just nonsense.”
To summarize the main points about the IHME’s projections
of U.S. deaths from COVID-19: During April 2020, the
IHME’s projections exhibited biases related to both unrealistic
optimism and overconfidence. At the time, the forecasts from
the IHME were the most closely followed by the U.S. media
among all institutions forecasting cases and deaths. I suggest
that biased IHME projections during April contributed to
fostering a political environment that facilitated the relaxation of
containment measures at the end of April in order to reopen the
economy at that time. As I mentioned above, doing so appears to
have induced a surge of COVID-19 cases beginning in June and
continuing through the summer. However, in May, the IHME’s
revised projections became less biased in the short-term (up to 2
months out), although continued to exhibit unrealistic optimism
and overconfidence in the long-term (beyond 2 months).
Key members of the coronavirus task force: During the
first week of April, Dr. Fauci publicly stated that the total
number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 might be about 60,000,
a figure consistent with the IHME’s point forecast from that
period. In retrospect, this was surprising for two reasons. First,
it came a week after Dr. Birx had first communicated a lower
bound of 100,000. Second, the president’s private estimate for
annual deaths was in the range of 125,000–150,000. In any case,
just as with the IHME point forecast from that period, 60,000
was much too low, reflecting significant optimism bias on the
part of Dr. Fauci.
The president’s public pronouncements set the tone for
government officials, especially the group within the White
House that was charged with setting pandemic policy and which
was led by the Chief of Staff. Most of the group members were
aides to the President, and only one member was a public health
official, and that was Dr. Birx.
Groupthink is a phenomenon in which group members
display insufficient devil’s advocacy and are prone to downplay
judgmental differences because they feel the need to support the
position of the group leader or are concerned that expressing
differences of opinion will weaken the group’s esprit de corps. I
suggest that elements of groupthink operated in White House
decision making.
Garrett, quoted in Bruni (2020), speaks of Drs. Birx and Fauci
having to “tiptoe around a president’s tender ego.” Coverage
by The New York Times indicates that during April, Dr. Birx,
presented information which supported what the president was
hoping to hear, information that would justify reopening the U.S.
economy as early as possible. Notably, Dr. Fauci, who was not
invited to be a member of the inner group, frequently delivered
public messages that were opposite to those of the president,
and in July became the target of a campaign by the Chief of
Staff to undermine his credibility. In this respect, Dr. Fauci,
described himself as “skunk at the garden party” for offering
a more pessimistic outlook than what the president had been
communicating32
.
It is possible that there is evidence to the contrary, but if not,
it seems plausible to suggest that White House policy makers
ignored Dr. Murray’s April 12 warning mentioned above. In this
regard, the New York Times coverage highlights the failure of
Dr. Birx’s framework to control for the impact on reduced social
distancing as a result of reopening the economy. In this regard,
the IHME reports that social distancing peaked at the same time
new (daily) cases, and then began to decline. It is also plausible
to suggest that invoking the IHME’s projections when supportive
of the policy they favored, but ignoring the warnings when they
regarded those warnings as not supportive, is consistent with
motivated reasoning.
During the first week of August, in a public address, Dr. Birx
indicated that the pandemic was entering a new phase in the
U.S., as the virus spread into rural areas. Her remarks drew
a rebuke from the president, communicated through a tweet.
The president suggested that Dr. Birx’s remarks were critical of
his policies, and that she was responding to negative remarks
about her by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The Speaker’s remarks followed the publication of an article
by the New York Times (Shear et al., 2020) that contained
an unflattering description of Dr. Birx’s role in White House
decision making.
The New York Times article mentioned that the modeling
done by Dr. Birx during April had inappropriately extrapolated
32See Shear et al. (2020).
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 590594fpsyg-11-590594 October 31, 2020 Time: 21:3 # 9
Shefrin Biased U.S. COVID-19 Forecasts
the experience of Italy to the U.S33. Dr. Birx responded to
the article by saying that she wished the New York Times
would have interviewed her for the article, and emphasized
her reliance on data, a practice she had developed in a career
spanning four decades.
Being data driven is different from analyzing data using
techniques that are unbiased (Fildes et al., 2009; Goodwin,
2017; Harvey, 2007). The issue about placing excessive weight
on the experience of Italy when developing predictions about
the U.S. relates to psychological biases stemming from reliance
on representativeness and similarity (Kahneman and Tversky,
1973; Tversky, 1977). Did Dr. Birx misjudge the degree to which
the U.S. and Italy were similar, and the degree to which the
experience of Italy was representative of the situation in which
the U.S. found itself? The same questions apply to the projections
made by the IHME in April 2020 (see Figures 1, 2).
During a public presentation in early August, Dr. Birx
responded to a question about whether the number of U.S.
COVID-19 related deaths would surpass 300,000 by the end
of 2020, a figure suggested by a former commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Birx responded to the
question by saying “anything is possible,” and noted that such
an outcome would be far less likely if Americans practiced
appropriate social distancing and avoided mass gatherings
(see Hawkins and Iati, 2020).
Keep in mind that the IHME projections made in midSeptember 2020, and ending January 1, 2021 lie above 300,000
and in addition display no asymptotes, meaning that by January
2021 the IHME’s projection curves had not yet plateaued. Indeed,
the IHME website states that IHME leaders believe that the
pandemic will be no more than half over by the end of 2020.
In mid-August, Dr. Birx expanded on these points, in remarks
at a conference, by coming back to the issue of Italy, saying: “I
wish that when we went into lockdown, we looked like Italy.
When Italy locked down, I mean, people weren’t allowed out
of their houses, they couldn’t come out but once every 2 weeks
to buy groceries for 1 hour and they had to have a certificate
that said they were allowed. Americans don’t react well to that
kind of prohibition” (Mascarenhas et al., 2020). These comments
speak to the issues of bias stemming from representativeness and
similarity mentioned above. In respect to the U.S., Dr. Birx also
commented that: “Tens of thousands of lives can be saved if we
wear masks, and we don’t have parties in our backyards... taking
those masks off ”34
.
Figure 6 displays the cumulative deaths from COVID-19
for a series of select countries. Notice that the curves for all
countries shown, except the U.S. and Brazil reach plateaus at
the right. The U.S. and Brazil stand in this regard. According
33Italy’s initial response to the outbreak was weak, as reflected in the slogan
“Milano non si ferma,” meaning Milan does not stop.
34The same article quotes Jared Kushner, another member of the White House
coronavirus decision group, who took issue with Dr. Birx’s comments. Kushner
made the point that the group’s intent was to establish policy so that the U.S.
healthcare system would not be inundated by COVID-19 patients to the same
extent as Italy. In this respect, the number of deaths per capita are similar for the
U.S. and Italy; however, Italy only had 25% of the confirmed cases per million as
the U.S., and so its fatality rate was much higher. At the same time, cases and deaths
per capital have plateaued in Italy relative to the U.S.

to Dr. Birx, the difference between achieving a plateau, and not,
centers on containment policy such as the wearing of masks and
social distancing35
.
To summarize the main points about the judgments of Drs.
Birx and Fauci about U.S. deaths from COVID-19: I suggest
that unrealistically optimistic forecasts from Drs. Birx and Fauci
during April, especially Dr. Birx because of her role in White
House decision making, contributed to fostering a political
environment that facilitated the relaxation of containment
measures at the end of April in order to reopen the economy at
that time. As I discussed, doing so appears to have induced a surge
of COVID-19 cases beginning in June and continuing through
the summer. There is reason to believe that elements associated
with groupthink might have impacted Dr. Birx who has struggled
to deal with the president’s strategic misrepresentation policy and
strong personality.
After negative coverage in July from the New York Times
about her actions in the White House, Dr. Birx made a series
of public statements about weak containment measures in the
U.S. Notably, she implicitly explained the source of bias in
her April forecasts, namely the over-extrapolation of Italy’s
experience with COVID-19. She also downplayed the possibility
of reaching 300,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by the end of
2020. However, IHME’s point forecasts from mid-September do
indeed feature more than 300,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19
by January 1, 2021. By the end of 2020, if not before, it will be
possible to test whether Dr. Birx’s judgments continued to feature
unrealistic optimism bias.
Media reporting indicates that the addition of Dr. Atlas,
mentioned above, to the coronavirus task force, has made the
work of that body more difficult, or “nightmarish” to use the
term attributed to Dr. Birx (Acosta, 2020). Whereas Drs. Birx

cases began to surge in the UK, France, and Germany.

and Fauci were attempting to emphasize the importance of
measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, Dr. Atlas
was downplaying the need to do so, while promoting the view
that the U.S. was close to or had already reached herd immunity.
The president’s public position has been much closer to that of
Dr. Atlas who in August began to appear next to the president
during press briefings about the pandemic (Acosta, 2020).
CONCLUSION
During September 2020, the total number of U.S. COVID-19
deaths surpassed 200,000. This number was considerably larger
than the forecasts made in the first 4 months of the year by
President Trump, the president’s medical advisers Drs. Deborah
Birx and Anthony Fauci, and the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.
The president’s forecasts mostly reflected strategic
manipulation, an attempt to induce unrealistic optimism in the
U.S. in order to limit containment measures, thereby mitigating
the impact on the U.S. economy and financial markets. The
manipulation featured a series of psychological phenomena,
such as availability bias, desirability, elements of groupthink,
anchoring and adjustment, representativeness, and similarity.
Biased forecasts of cases and deaths made by Drs. Birx,
Fauci, and the IHME in March and April contributed to
fostering a political environment that facilitated the relaxation
of containment measures at the end of April in order to reopen
the economy at that time. Notably, the IHME’s projections in
mid-April were unrealistically optimistic in respect to both total
number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 and the projected dates
for full containment. The premature relaxation of containment
measures appears to have induced a surge of COVID-19 cases
beginning in June that swept across the country.
Drs. Birx, Fauci, and the IHME subsequently revised their
April forecasts, stressing the need for the U.S. public to follow
prudent containment measures such as wearing masks and
maintaining social distancing. The IHME, which in April forecast
that by August 4 the pandemic would be fully contained, stated
in September that it then expected that on January 1, 2021, the
country would only be halfway through the pandemic. Notably,
the IHME’s forecasts for more than 2 months out has consistently
exhibited overconfidence as well as unrealistic optimism.
Dr. Birx, who had often stood next to the president during his
press briefings on the pandemic, and was reluctant to contradict
him in public, began to do so in August. Her remarks were
especially instructive about some of the thinking in April 2020.
At that time her view, and also that of the IHME, was that U.S.
fatalities from COVID-19 would follow a similar trajectory as
Italy. However, the situation in Italy was not representative of
the U.S. in respect to willingness to tolerate strong lockdown
measures. Whereas, the government of Italy eventually chose to
impose strong lockdown measures, and Italians mostly complied,
a large segment of the U.S. population resisted containment,
and resonated to President Trump’s messaging on this point.
Figures 1, 2, 6 provide a stark graphic visualization of how the
experiences of Italy and the U.S. differed.

Abstract
With the emerging outbreak of a novel coronavirus, millions of people have been
followed social distancing rules to self-quarantine at home. Given the continuation of
this pandemic trend, people who have suffered from the anxiety of coronavirus and
experienced social isolation their psychological well-being started to be concerned.
During this time, one popular video game called “Animal Crossing: New Horizons”
successfully get everyone's attention and led us to explore the psychology behind
video games. On the one hand, New Horizons provides a dreamland for the players
to temporally escape from the cruel reality with a risk of losing in escapism. On the
other hand, the New Horizons world becomes a perfect social platform to keep social
interaction with others to get rid of the loneliness.

1 | OVERVIEW OF PHENOMENON
In the past several months, many of us are either experiencing lockdown or voluntarily following the social distancing rules to minimize
our time spent outside due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Fighting the epidemic is a serious matter. Comparing with the importance that people attached to the epidemic trend and healthcare, the
release of a video game seems trivial to notice. However, Animal
Crossing: New Horizons, a life simulation video game, brought unexpected magic to get the public attention and let us rethink the psychology behind the game.
New Horizons is the fifth main series title in the Animal Crossing
series. It is developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo
Switch, released in all regions on March 20, 2020. As in previous
installments in the Animal Crossing series, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a nonlinear life simulation game played in real-time. In New
Horizons, a player assumes the role of a customizable character who
moves to a deserted island to build and expand their home by granting
a loan, exploring their surroundings, interacting with a cast of adorable
animal villagers, catching bugs, collecting fish, designing their own
fashion, growing flowers, participating in annual events, and much
more. The game proceeds in an open-ended fashion and develops it
into a community of anthropomorphic animals. Players can also have
social interaction with other players online, which is one of the most
attractive parts of the game.
New Horizons have received massively popularity and acclaim
from game players and critics all over the world. It sold five million
digital copies in its first month, breaking the console game record for
most digital units sold in a single month. It became the best-selling
game in the Animal Crossing series after 6 weeks with 13.41 million
units sold (Wikipedia, 2020). At press time, the Nintendo Switch has
been sold out almost everywhere online and in-store at many popular
retailers.
2 | THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND
THE “GAME”
Many critics attribute its popularity to the “right timing.” As
Khan (2020) stated in The New York Times, the success has been

players seeking a sense of escapism in their self-quarantine at home.
Indeed, New Horizons could not have come at a better time. Or rather,
we can just consider the game world as the “La-la land,” a sort of
escape that has captivated in our fantasies with the world in the grip
of the epidemic; or, it plays an unexpected role to provide comfort
and social connection in a time of isolation and struggle. Therefore, it
is not hard to discover the two main psychological success behind this
phenomenon: first, it captures people's instinctive to escape from
realistic difficulties and their yearning to chase a peaceful and harmonious life; then, it satisfies people's unwillingness to be lonely and
their deep inner desire for the social interaction to get rid of the
loneliness.
3 | A DREAMLAND OR A TEMPORARY
ESCAPE?
If there is a dreamland to escape from the coronavirus, video game
must be one. In New Horizons, players take the role of the only
human being who lives on an island surrounded by pudgy anthropomorphic animals. Inside the game world, there are no mountains of
work and demanding bosses; you do not have to worry about that
tomorrow might be the day to hand in your homework; of course,
there is also no exact date on which you should pay back what you
owe; most importantly, there is no disaster and disease exists, it is
like a haven that keeps you away from COVID-19. The game is
played at a relaxed pace, in which the player can choose what they
want to do on any given day. “There's no nastiness and violence that
exists. They get absorbed into the day-to-day things without the
real-world consequences,” said Romana Ramzan, a lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland. “It's like you've been transported to a parallel universe where you've always wanted but hard
to reach out” (Khan, 2020). Compare to the everyday pressure you
have to face from reality, who would not want to live in this
dreamland?
However, from the other point of view, this dreamland only provides a virtual world over the cloud that allowing you to escape from
the cruel reality temporarily, eventually, this escapism could not last
long after all. This delicate relationship represents a microcosm of
the psychological problems that people experience in real life.
According to Hussain and Griffiths (2009), over one-third of gamers
claimed that relaxation and escape was a key function of playing. In
another study of online gaming, the best predictor of a high score on
Young (1998) for Internet addiction was escapism, indicating that
players use online games to avoid thinking about real-life problems.
Players who have the motivation to escape from life problems may
experience more negative outcomes from their online gaming
(Kardefelt-Winther, 2014). In our case, New Horizons may temporarily play a “shelter” role to provide a simple happy life to the players;
however, the negative outcomes of escapism that may affect people's psychological well-being should be concerned in future studies
as well.
4 | “ONLY” BUT NOT LONELY
Social interaction is another highlight of the game's success, and it is
highly related to ones' psychological well-being to get rid of the
loneliness. Even being the only human on the island in the game
does not mean that you have to live alone there. The most fascinating part of the game is that the players can continue to socialize virtually even they remain in physical isolation for long periods during
the COVID-19 pandemic. As we all know, social isolation has
significant implications for mental and physical health. There is one
meta-analysis estimates that loneliness and social isolation can
be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day
(Edwards, 2013). Research has shown that people who experienced
socially isolated may get a greater risk of becoming lonely and that
being surrounded by a social network of meaningful personal relationships is crucial for feeling socially embedded and for the alleviation of loneliness (De Jong Gierveld, Van Tilburg, & Dykstra, 2006).
The benefits of playing games with others online have been
highlighted in research by Cole and Griffiths (2007). They found that
75% of the participants made appropriate pals due to taking part in
online games and 30% met a romantic associate via a game. These
friendships are often of excessive-quality, with over one in three
people pointing out that they talk to their online friends about problems that they would not speak to their offline friends
(Platinum, 2020). New Horizons provides a perfect social platform to
expand personal relationships with others no matter for the introverts or extraverts. The gamers not only can invite others to their
islands to trade items but also can talk and hang out virtually. There
are even real stories of people having weddings on the game after
their ceremonies had been canceled in real life. It is a thoughtful
way to make memories and have some laughs during the time they
cannot in person. New Horizons fulfills the players' desire to continue social contact with each other during the COVID-19 epidemic
and further reducing their feelings of loneliness.
5 | CONCLUSION
The coronavirus outbreak has put a heavy stone onto everyone's
shoulder and everyone is trying their best to cope with it in their own
way. As a global epidemic, it has brought too many painful memories.
The pressure and anxiety caused by the fear of viruses in real life
make people pay more attention to mental health problems.
Video games have always appeared to the public with a relatively
negative image. However, in this crisis, their players in some ways are
benefited. New Horizons has opened the door to a parallel world,
bought spiritual comfort and sustenance to their fans. People can easily find calm and peace in the game and escape from the suffering of
reality to alleviate psychological anxiety and depression. However, at
the same time, the negative outcomes of escapism that affect people's
psychological well-being should be concerned in future studies. In the
game, continuing social interaction with old friends or making new friends could be a relaxing and fun way to stay connected with loved
158 ZHUones and helps people to get rid of the loneliness caused by social isolation. Overall, during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter the experiences of anxiety and escapism, or the social isolation and loneliness,
New Horizons made us realize the psychology behind video games has
far more than we have already known. In front, more treasures are
waiting to be explored for future studies.

Positive education and school psychology during covid-19 pandamic

As coronavirus rages around the globe, its impact 
extends to 1.6 billion students (94% of the learner 
population) across almost 200 countries (UN, 2020), 
many of whom do not have adequate resources to fully 
engage in remote learning (Hall et al., 2020).
Coronavirus pandemic has quickly changed the context 
in which people live, increasing exposure to risks. The 
pandemic’s disruptions are far-reaching. Compared to 
pre-pandemic indicators, many young people are 
craving the social aspect of their school lives (Burke & 
Dempsey, 2020), reporting less engagement with play 
(Moore et al., 2020), and lower levels of wellbeing 
(Quinn et al., 2020). Teachers and school leaders find 
remote instruction challenging (Devitt et al., 2020), and 
the prospect operating schools side-by-side with the 
pandemic fills many with apprehension (Burke, 2020). 
In these unsettled times, more than ever, positive school 
psychology research is required.
Academic databases indicate that less than 1% of 
the current COVID-19-related research considers a 
positive psychological perspective, and there are even 
fewer studies in the field of positive education during 
the pandemic. A growing number of academic 
publications demonstrate the potential ways positive 
psychology can help educators manage distance 
learning during the pandemic successfully. Following 
past positive education research findings, we recognize 
the significant role that meaning-making, psychological 
flexibility, resilience, belonging, or positive affect can
play during a global crisis (e.g., Arslan, 2020; Arslan et 
al., 2020; Fredrickson et al., 2003; Frydenberg et al., 
2012; Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004; Wong, 2011; 
Yıldırım, & Güler, 2020; Yıldırım, & Solmaz, 2020). 
Nonetheless, expanded positive school psychology 
research that bridges the science-to-practice gap is 
needed to counteract the impact of COVID-19 on the 
school communities worldwide.
Theories suggest that close family and school 
relations foster young people’s mental health and 
promote their psychological resilience during the 
pandemic (Arslan, 2020; Prime et al., 2020). Some 
authors acknowledge the potential of COVID-19 to 
initiate post-traumatic growth in both individuals and 
communities (Shakespeare-Finch et al., 2020). In a 
rapid survey carried out merely one week after the 
pandemic-related school closure, with almost 3,000 
school leaders, half of them reported that the school 
closure would positively affect their staff and students 
(Burke & Dempsey, 2020). Similar findings were 
reported post-SARS pandemic. In the SARS study, the 
majority (86%) of people directly affected by the SARS 
virus acknowledged the benefits of experiencing it 
(Cheng et al., 2006). As traumatic as COVID-19 is to
many now, it could also become a springboard for 
positive change, especially in schools that draw on 
positive education research to support staff wellbeing 
and sustain programs and services that foster students’ 
social-emotional health.
Growing evidence demonstrates that positive 
changes are indeed emerging among the pandemicaffected school communities. For example, in a survey 
of almost 1,000 school principals during the early 
pandemic-related lockdown, many leaders reported 
they began new hobbies, created healthier personal 
routines, and started to exercise more regularly. They 
also enjoyed a less hectic pace of life than they had 
before the pandemic lockdown (Dempsey & Burke, 
2020). Parents reported similar experiences. Many Burke & Arslan 138
found that caring for their children during the lockdown 
resulted in high positive affect levels and increased 
exercising (going for walks, gardening, pursuing a 
hobby; Lades et al., 2020). More such studies are 
needed that highlight the conditions and incidents of 
positive changes during the pandemic.
Although we hope for this public health crisis to end 
soon, the pandemic signifies to be more extended than 
initially expected. Positive school psychology literacy 
is thus necessary for developing science that informed 
evidence helping students to cope with the challenges. 
In this regard, we encourage researchers, counsellors, 
mental health providers, and school authorities to 
develop effective interventions in school context, 
online or face-to-face where applicable, to support 
students' mental health and academic development. For 
example, given that in most countries’ education has 
been done online during pandemic which has potential 
to affect students' sense of belonging to the school and 
mental health, implementation of such interventions 
would be particularly important to promote positive 
mental health. Therefore, we believe that application 
of the principles of positive psychology that emphasizes 
human strengths into school context can play a key role 
for the promotion of positive education and school 
psychology. The Journal of Positive School Psychology 
thus supports these efforts and invites manuscripts 
informing educators and mental health providers of best 
practices that sustain staff, parents, students’ coping, 
resilience, and wellbeing during this most challenging 
worldwide emergency.

EVOLUTION OF RESPONSES TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE U.S.

Abstract. Disruptions resulting from an epidemic might often appear to amount to chaos but, in reality, can be
understood in a systematic way through the lens of “epidemic psychology”. According to Philip Strong, the founder
of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, not only is an epidemic biological; there is also the potential
for three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong’s model
at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S.
during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by
different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite
the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the
first death in the country), users’ fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to
change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures,
users settled into a “new normal” for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off
as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold. During 2020, as cases surged in waves, so did anger,
re-emerging cyclically at each wave. Our real-time operationalization of Strong’s model is designed in a way that
makes it possible to embed epidemic psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological and mobility models).
Introduction
In our daily lives, our dominant perception is of order. But every now and then chaos threatens that order: epidemics
dramatically break out, revolutions erupt, empires suddenly fall, and stock markets crash. Epidemics, in particular,
present not only collective health hazards but also special challenges to mental health and public order that need
to be addressed by social and behavioral sciences [Van Bavel et al., 2020]. Almost 30 years ago, in the wake of the
AIDS epidemic, Philip Strong, the founder of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, reflected: “the
human origin of epidemic psychology lies not so much in our unruly passions as in the threat of epidemic disease
to our everyday assumptions.” [Strong, 1990] In the recent COVID-19 pandemic [Brooks et al., 2020] (an ongoing
pandemic of a coronavirus disease), it has been shown that the main source of uncertainty and anxiety has indeed
come from the disruption of what Alfred Shutz called the “routines and recipes” of daily life [Schutz et al., 1973]
(e.g., every simple act, from eating at work to visiting our parents, takes on new meanings).
Yet, the chaos resulting from an epidemic turns out to be more predictable than what one would initially expect.
Philip Strong observed that any new health epidemic resulted into three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. The epidemic of fear represents the fear of catching the disease, which comes with the suspicion
against alleged disease carriers, which, in turn, may spark panic and irrational behavior. The epidemic of moralization is characterized by moral responses both to the viral epidemic itself and to the epidemic of fear, which
may result in either positive reactions (e.g., cooperation) or negative ones (e.g., stigmatization). The epidemic of
action accounts for the rational or irrational changes of daily habits that people make in response to the disease
or as a result of the two other psycho-social epidemics. Strong was writing in the wake of the AIDS/HIV crisis,
but he based his model on studies that went back to Europe’s Black Death in the 14th century. Importantly, he
showed that these three psycho-social epidemics are created by language and incrementally fed through it: language
transmits the fear that the infection is an existential threat to humanity and that we are all going to die; language
depicts the epidemic as a verdict on human failings and as a moral judgment on minorities; and language shapes
the means through which people collectively intend to, however pointless, act against the threat.
There have been numerous studies of how information propagated on social media during epidemic outbreaks
occurred in the past decade, such as Zika [Fu et al., 2016, Wood, 2018, Sommariva et al., 2018], Ebola [Oyeyemi

et al., 2014], and the H1N1 influenza [Chew and Eysenbach, 2010]. Similarly, with the outbreak of COVID-19, people
around the world have been collectively expressing their thoughts and concerns about the pandemic on social media.
As such, researchers studied this epidemic from multiple angles: social media posts have been analyzed in terms of
content and behavioral markers [Hou et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020], and of tracking the diffusion of COVID-related
information [Cinelli et al., 2020] and misinformation [Pulido et al., 2020, Ferrara, 2020, Kouzy et al., 2020, Yang
et al., 2020]. Search queries have suggested specific information-seeking responses to the pandemic [Bento et al.,
2020]. Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been studied mostly though surveys [Wang et al., 2020, Qiu
et al., 2020].
Hitherto, there has never been any large-scale empirical study of whether the use of language during an epidemic
reflects Strong’s model. With the opportunity of having a sufficiently large-scale data at hand, we set out to test
whether Strong’s model did hold on Twitter during COVID-19, and did so at the scale of an entire country, that
of the United States. By running our study on Twitter, we expose the interpretation of our results to a number of
limitations, notably to issues of representativeness [Li et al., 2013], self-presentation biases [Waterloo et al., 2018],
and data noise [Saif et al., 2012, Ferrara et al., 2016]. Indeed, recent surveys estimated that only 22% of U.S.
adults use Twitter [Wojcik and Hughes, 2019], and that the characteristics of these users deviate from the general
population’s: compared to the average adult in the U.S., Twitter users are much younger, are more likely to have
college degrees, and are slightly more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. Despite such limitations, social
media represents the response of a relevant part of the general population to global events, and it does so at a scale
and a granularity that have been so far unattainable by publicly-available data sources.
After operationalizing Strong’s model by using lexicons for psycholinguistic text analysis, upon the collection of
122M tweets about the epidemic from February 1st to December 31st, we conducted a quantitative analysis on the
differences in language style and a thematic analysis of the actual social media posts. The temporal scope of our
study does not capture the full pandemic as it is still ongoing at the time of writing but it includes the three major
contagion waves in the U.S., characterizing the entire year of 2020. The first wave captured the initial diffusion of
the virus in the world, and then its arrival and first peak in the U.S. The following two waves captured subsequent
periods of alarming diffusion.
The three psycho-social epidemics, as theorized by Strong, evolve concurrently over time. In the particular case
of our period of study, we found that this concurrent evolution resulted into three regimes or phases, which are
not part of Strong’s theoretical framework and experimentally emerged. In the first phase (the refusal phase), the
psycho-social epidemic of fear began. Twitter users in the U.S. refused to accept reality: they feared the uncertainty
created by the disruption of what was considered to be “normal”; focused their moral concerns on others in an act
of distancing oneself from others; yet, despite all this, they refused to change the normal course of action. After
the announcement of the first death in the country, the second phase (the anger phase) began: the psycho-social
epidemic of fear intensified while the epidemics of morality and action kicked-off abruptly. Twitter users expressed
more anger than fear about the looming feeling that things were about to change; focused their moral concerns on
oneself in an act of reckoning with what was happening; and suspended their daily activities. After the authorities
imposed physical-distancing measures, the third phase (the acceptance phase) took over: the epidemic of fear started
to fade away while the epidemics of morality and action turned into more constructive and forward-looking social
processes. Twitter users expressed more sadness than anger or fear; focused their moral concerns on the collective
and, in so doing, promoted pro-social behavior; and found a “new normal” in their daily activities, which consisted
of their past daily activities being physically restricted to their homes and neighborhoods. The phase of acceptance
dominated Twitter conversations for the rest of the year, although the anger phase re-emerged cyclically with the
rise of new waves of contagion. In particular, we observed two peaks of anger: when the death toll in the U.S.
reached 100,000 people (second contagion wave), and when President Trump tested positive to COVID-19 (third
contagion wave).
Dataset
From an existing collection of COVID-related tweets [Chen et al., 2020], we gathered 554,941,519 tweets posted
between February 1st up to December 31st. We focused our analysis on the United States, the country where
Twitter penetration is highest. To identify Twitter users living in it, we parsed the free-text location description of
their user profile (e.g., “San Francisco, CA”). We did so by using a set of custom regular expressions that match
variations for the expression “United States of America”, as well as the names of 333 cities and 51 states in the U.S.
(and their combinations). Albeit not always accurate, matching location strings against known location names is
a tested approach that yields good results for a coarse-grained localization at state or country-level [Dredze et al.,
2013]. Overall, we were left with 6,271,835 unique users in the U.S. who posted 122,320,155 tweets in English.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 3
Before analyzing how our language categories unfolded over time, we experimentally tested whether the number of
data points at hand was sufficient to compute our metrics. It was indeed the case as the number of active users
per day varied from a minimum of 72k on February 2nd to a maximum of 1.84M on March 18th, with and average
of 437k. A small number of accounts tweeted a disproportionately high number of times, reaching a maximum of
15,823 tweets; those were clearly automated accounts, which were discarded by our methodology. As we shall discuss
in Methods, we normalized all our aggregate temporal measures so that they were not affected by the fluctuating
volume of tweets over time.
Methods
Coding Strong’s model. Back in the 1990s, Philip Strong was able not only to describe the psychological impact
of epidemics on social order but also to model it. He observed that the early reaction to major fatal epidemics
is a distinctive psycho-social form and can be modeled along three main dimensions: fear, morality, and action.
During a large-scale epidemic, basic assumptions about social interaction and, more generally, about social order are
disrupted, and, more specifically, they are so by: the fear of others, competing moralities, and the responses to the
epidemic. Crucially, all these three elements are created, transmitted, and mediated by language: language transmits
fears, elaborates on the stigmatization of minorities, and shapes the means through which people collectively respond
to the epidemic [Strong, 1990, Goffman, 2009, Cap, 2016].
As opposed to existing attempts to model psychological and social aspects of epidemic crises [McConnell, 2005,
Khan and Huremovi´c, 2019], Strong’s model meets our three main choice criteria:
(1) Well-grounded. It proposes a comprehensive, highly-cited, and still relevant theoretical model, which is
based on an extensive review of studies of past large-scale epidemics that did span centuries and, as such,
were of different nature, speaking to the generalizability of the framework.
(2) Focused on psycho-social aspects. Its main goal is to characterize people’s psychological and social responses
to epidemics rather than describing how an epidemic unfolds over time.
(3) Directly operationalizable from language use. The description of the psycho-social responses provided by
Strong lends itself to operationalization, as its defining concepts have been mapped to language markers by
previous literature (as Table 1 shows).
We operationalized Strong’s epidemic psychology theoretical framework in two steps. First, three authors handcoded Strong’s seminal paper [Strong, 1990] using line-by-line coding [Gibbs, 2007] to identify keywords that
characterize the three psycho-social epidemics. For each of the three psycho-social epidemics, the three authors
generated independent lists of keywords that were conservatively combined by intersecting them. The words that
were left out by the intersection were mostly synonyms (e.g., “catching disease” as a synonym for “contagion”), so
we did not discard any important concept. According to Strong, the three psycho-social epidemics are intertwined
and, as such, the concepts that define one specific psycho-social epidemic might be relevant to the remaining two
as well. For example, suspicion is an element of the epidemic of fear but is tightly related to stigmatization as well,
a phenomenon that Strong describes as typical of the epidemic of moralization. In our coding exercise, we adhered
as much as possible to the description in Strong’s paper and obtained a strict partition of keywords across psychosocial epidemics. In the second step, the same three authors mapped each of these keywords to language categories,
namely sets of words that reflect how these concepts are expressed in natural language (e.g., words expressing anger
or trust). We took these categories from four existing language lexicons widely used in psychometric studies:
• Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) [Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010]. A lexicon of words and word
stems grouped into over 125 categories reflecting emotions, social processes, and basic functions, among
others. The LIWC lexicon is based on the premise that the words people use to communicate can provide
clues to their psychological states [Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010]. It allows written passages to be analyzed
syntactically (how the words are used together to form phrases or sentences) and semantically (an analysis
of the meaning of the words or phrases).
• Emolex [Mohammad and Turney, 2013]. A lexicon that classifies 6k+ words and stems into the eight
primary emotions of Plutchik’s psychoevolutionary theory [Plutchik, 1991].
• Moral Foundation Lexicon [Graham et al., 2009]. A lexicon of 318 words and stems, which are grouped into
5 categories of moral foundations [Graham et al., 2013]: harm, fairness, in-group, authority, and purity.
Each of which is further split into expressions of virtue or vice.4 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER
• Pro-social behavior [Frimer et al., 2014]. A lexicon of 146 pro-social words and stems, which have been
found to be frequently used when people describe pro-social goals[Frimer et al., 2014].
The three authors grouped similar keywords together and mapped groups of keywords to one or more language
categories. This grouping and mapping procedure was informed by previous studies that investigated how these
keywords are expressed through language. These studies are listed in Table 1.
Language categories over time. We considered that a tweet contained a language category c if at least one
of the tweet’s words or stems belonged to that category. The tweet-category association is binary and disregards
the number of matching words within the same tweet. That is mainly because, in short snippets of text (tweets
are limited to 280 characters), multiple occurrences are rare and do not necessarily reflect the intensity of a category [Russell, 2013]. For each language category c, we counted the number of users Uc(t) who posted at least
one tweet at time t containing that category. We then obtained the fraction of users who mentioned category c by
dividing Uc(t) by the total number of users U(t) who tweeted at time t:
(1) fc(t) = Uc(t)
U(t)
.
Computing the fraction of users rather than the fraction of tweets prevents biases introduced by exceptionally active
users, thus capturing more faithfully the prevalence of different language categories in our Twitter population.
This also helps discounting the impact of social bots, which tend to have anomalous levels of activity (especially
retweeting [Bessi and Ferrara, 2016]).
Different categories might be verbalized with considerably different frequencies. For example, the language category
“I” (first-person pronoun) from the LIWC lexicon naturally occurred much more frequently than the category
“death” from the same lexicon. To enable a comparison across categories, we standardized all the fractions:
(2) zc(t) = fc(t) − µ[0,T](fc)
σ[0,T](fc)
,
where µ(fc) and σ(fc) represent the mean and standard deviation of the fc(t) scores over the whole time period,
from t = 0 (February 1st) to t = T (April 16th). These z-scores ease also the interpretation of the results as
they represent the relative variation of a category’s prevalence compared to its average: they take on values higher
(lower) than zero when the original value is higher (lower) than the average.
Other behavioral markers. To assess the validity of our operationalization of Strong’s model, we compared its
results with the output of alternative state-of-the-art text-mining techniques, and with real-world mobility patterns.
Interaction types. We compared the results obtained via word-matching with a state-of-the-art deep learning tool
for Natural Language Processing designed to capture fundamental types of social interactions from conversational
language [Choi et al., 2020]. This tool uses Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (LSTMs) [Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997] that take in input a 300-dimensional GloVe representation of words [Pennington et al., 2014]
and output a series of confidence scores in the range [0, 1] that estimate the likelihood that the text expresses certain
types of social interactions. The classifiers exhibited a very high classification performance, up to an Area Under
the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.98. AUC is a performance metric that measures the ability of the model to assign
higher confidence scores to positive examples (i.e., text characterized by the type of interaction of interest) than to
negative examples, independent of any fixed decision threshold; the expected value for random classification is 0.5,
whereas an AUC of 1 indicates a perfect classification.
Out of the ten interaction types that the tool can classify [Deri et al., 2018], three were detected frequently with
likelihood > 0.5 in our Twitter data: conflict (expressions of contrast or diverging views [Tajfel et al., 1979]), social
support (giving emotional or practical aid and companionship [Fiske et al., 2007]), and power (expressions that
mark a person’s power over the behavior and outcomes of another [Blau, 1964]).
Given a tweet’s textual message m and an interaction type i, we used the classifier to compute the likelihood
score li(m) that the message contains that interaction type. We then binarized the confidence scores using a
threshold-based indicator function:
(3) l
θ
i
(m) = (
1, if li(m) ≥ θi
0, otherwise
Following the original approach [Choi et al., 2020], we used a different threshold for each interaction type, as the
distributions of their likelihood scores tend to vary considerably. We thus picked conservatively θi as the value of
the 85th percentile of the distribution of the confidence scores li
, thus favoring precision over recall. Last, similar toHOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 5

Table 1. Operationalization of the Strong’s epidemic psychology theoretical framework. From Strong’s paper,
three annotators extracted keywords that characterize the three psycho-social epidemics and mapped them to
relevant language categories from existing language lexicons used in psychometric studies. Category names are
followed by the name of their corresponding lexicon in parenthesis. We support the association between keywords
and language categories with examples of supporting literature. To summarize how the use of the language categories varies across the three temporal states, we computed the peak values of the different language categories
(days when their standardized fractions reached the maximum), and reported the percentage increase at peak
compared to the average over the whole time period; in each row, the maximum value is highlighted in bold.6 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER
how we constructed temporal signals for the language categories, we counted the number of users Ui(t) who posted
at least one tweet at time t that contains interaction type i. We then obtained the fraction of users who mentioned
interaction type i by dividing Ui(t) by the total number of users U(t) who tweeted at time t:
(4) fi(t) = Ui(t)
U(t)
.
Last, we min-max normalized these fractions, considering the minimum and maximum values during the whole time
period [0, T]:
(5) fi(t) = fi(t) − min[0,T](fi)
max[0,T](fi) − min[0,T](fi)
.
Mentions of medical entities. We used a state-of-the-art deep learning method for medical entity extraction to
identify medical symptoms on Twitter in relation to COVID-19 [Scepanovic et al., 2020]. When applied to tweets,
the method extracts n-grams representing medical symptoms (e.g., “feeling sick”). This method is based on the
Bi-LSTM sequence-tagging architecture [Huang et al., 2015] in combination with GloVe word embeddings [Pennington et al., 2014] and RoBERTa contextual embeddings [Liu et al., 2019]. To optimize the entity extraction
performance on noisy textual data from social media, we trained its sequence-tagging architecture on the Micromed
database [Jimeno-Yepes et al., 2015], a collection of tweets manually labeled with medical entities. The hyperparameters we used are: 256 hidden units, a batch size of 4, and a learning rate of 0.1 which we gradually halved
whenever there was no performance improvement after 3 epochs. We trained for a maximum of 200 epochs or
before the learning rate became too small (≤ .0001). The final model achieved an F1-score of .72 on Micromed.
The F1-score is a performance measure that combines precision (the fraction of extracted entities that are actually
medical entities) and recall (the fraction of medical entities present in the text that the method is able to retrieve).
We based our implementation on Flair [Akbik et al., 2019] and Pytorch [Paszke et al., 2017], two popular deep
learning libraries in Python.
For each unique medical entity e, we counted the number of users Ue(t) who posted at least one tweet at time t
that mentioned that entity. We then obtained the fraction of users who mentioned medical entity e by dividing
Ue(t) by the total number of users U(t) who tweeted at time t:
(6) fe(t) = Ue(t)
U(t)
.
Last, we min-max normalize these fractions, considering the minimum and maximum values during the whole time
period [0, T]:
(7) fe(t) = fe(t) − min[0,T](fe)
max[0,T](fe) − min[0,T](fe)

Mobility traces. Foursquare is a local search and discovery mobile application that relies on the users’ past mobility
records to recommend places user might may like. The application uses GPS geo-localization to estimate the
user position and to infer the places they visited. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, Foursquare made publicly
available the data gathered from a pool of 13 million U.S. users. These users were “always-on” during the period of
data collection, meaning that they allowed the application to gather geo-location data at all times, even when the
application was not in use. The data (published through the visitdata.org website) consists of the daily number
of users vs,j visiting any venue of type j in state s, starting from February 1st to the present day (e.g., 419,256
users visited schools in Indiana on February 1st). Overall, 35 distinct location categories were provided. To obtain
country-wide temporal indicators, we first applied a min-max normalization to the vs,j values:
(8) vs,j (t) = vs,j (t) − min[0,T](vs,j )
max[0,T](vs,j ) − min[0,T](vs,j )
.
We then averaged the values across all states:
(9) vj (t) = 1

vs,j (t),
where S is the total number of states. By weighting each state equally, we obtained a measure that is more
representative of the whole U.S. territory, rather than being biased towards high-density regions.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 7
Time series smoothing. All our temporal indicators are affected by large day-to-day fluctuations. To extract
more consistent trends out of our time series, we applied a smoothing function—a common practice when analyzing
temporal data extracted from social media [O’Connor et al., 2010]. Given a time-varying signal x(t), we apply a
“boxcar” moving average over a window of the previous k days:
(10) x
∗
(t) =
Pt
i=t−k
x(i)
k
;
We selected a window of one week (k = 7). Weekly time windows are typically used to smooth out both day-to-day
variations as well as weekly periodicities [O’Connor et al., 2010]. We applied the smoothing to all the time series:
the language categories (z
∗
c
(t)), the mentions of medical entities (f
∗
e
(t)), the interaction types (f
∗
i
(t)), and the
foursquare visits (v
∗
j
(t)).
Change-point detection. To identify phases characterized by different combinations of the language categories,
we identified change-points—periods in which the values of all categories varied considerably at once. To quantify
such variations, for each language category c, we computed ∇(z
∗
c
(t)), namely the daily average squared gradient [L¨utkepohl, 2005] of the smoothed standardized fractions of that category. To calculate the gradient, we used
the Python function numpy.gradient. The gradient provides a measure of the rate of increase or decrease of the
signal; we consider the absolute value of the gradient, to account for the magnitude of change rather than the direction of change. To identify periods of consistent change as opposed to quick instantaneous shifts, we apply temporal
smoothing (Equation. 10) also to the time-series of gradients, and we denote the smoothed squared gradients with
∇∗
. Last, we average the gradients of all language categories to obtain the overall gradient over time:
(11) ∇(t) = 1
D
X
d
∇∗
(z

(t)).
Peaks in the time series ∇(t) represent the days of highest variation, and we marked them as change-points. Using
the Python function scipy.signal.find peaks, we identified peaks as the local maxima whose values is higher
than the average plus two standard deviations, as it is common practice [Palshikar et al., 2009].
Results
Language use until the first contagion wave. During the first wave, U.S. residents experienced what the
pandemic entailed for the first time, and did so by going through an entire life-cycle, making this contagion wave
self-contained: arrival of an unknown virus, skepticism, isolation measures, full lock-down, and first reopening.
Figure 1 (A-C) shows how the standardized fractions of all the language categories as per Formula (2) changed from
February 1st to April 15th, the day in which restrictions in most states were lifted. The cell color encodes values
higher than the average in red, and lower in blue. We partitioned the language categories according to the three
psycho-social epidemics. Figure 1 D shows the value of the average squared gradient over time (as per Formula 11);
peaks in the curve represent the days of high local variation. We marked the peaks above two standard deviations
from the mean as change-points. We found two change-points that coincide with two key events: February 27th
,
the day of the announcement of the first infection in the country; and March 24th, the day of the announcement
of the ‘stay at home’ orders. These change-points identify three phases, which are described next by dwelling on
the peaks of the different language categories (days when their standardized fractions reached the maximum) and
reporting the percentage increase at peak (the increase is compared to the average from February 1st to April 15th
,
and its peak is denoted by ‘max peak’ in Table 1). The first phase (refusal phase) was characterized by anxiety
and fear. Death was frequently mentioned, with a peak on February 11 of +45% compared to its average during
the whole time period. The pronoun they was used in this temporal state more than average; this suggests that
the focus of discussion was on the implications of the viral epidemic on ‘others’, as this was when no infection had
been discovered in the U.S. yet. All other language categories exhibited no significant variations, which reflected
an overall situation of ‘business-as-usual.’
The second phase (anger phase) began on February 27th with an outburst of negative emotions (predominantly
anger ), right after the first COVID-19 contagion in the U.S. was announced. The abstract fear of death was replaced
by expressions of concrete health concerns, such as words expressing risk, and mentions of how body parts did feel.
On March 13th, the federal government announced the state of national emergency, followed by the enforcement
of state-level ‘stay at home’ orders. During those days, we observed a sharp increase of the use of the pronoun I
and of swear words (with a peak of +54% on March 18th), which hints at a climate of discussion characterized by
conflict and polarization. At the same time, we observed an increase in the use of words related to the daily habits
affected by the impending restriction policies, such as motion, social activities, and leisure. The mentions of words8 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER

Figure 1. The Epidemic Psychology on Twitter during the first contagion wave. (A-C) evolution of the use
of different language categories over time in tweets related to COVID-19. Each row in the heatmaps represents
a language category (e.g., words expressing anxiety) that our manual coding associated with one of the three
psycho-social epidemics. The cell color represents the daily standardized fraction of people who used words related
to that category: values that are higher than the average are red and those that are lower are blue. Categories are
partitioned in three groups according to the type of psycho-social epidemics they model: Fear, Morality, and Action.
(D) average gradient (i.e., instantaneous variation) of all the language categories; the peaks of gradient identify
change-points—dates around which a considerable change in the use of multiple language categories happened at
once. The dashed vertical lines that cross all the plots represent these change-points. (E-H) temporal evolution of
four families of indicators we used to corroborate the validity of the trends identified by the language categories.
We checked internal validity by comparing the language categories with a custom keyword-search approach and
two deep-learning NLP tools that extract types of social interactions and mentions of medical symptoms. We
checked external validity by looking at mobility patterns in different venue categories as estimated by the GPS
geo-localization service of the Foursquare mobile app. The timeline at the bottom of the figure marks some of the
key events of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. such as the announcements of the first infection of COVID-19
recorded.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 9
related to home peaked on March 16th (+38%), the day when the federal government announced social distancing
guidelines to be in place for at least two weeks.
The third phase (acceptance phase) started on March 24th, the day after the first physical-distancing measures were
imposed by law. The increased use of words of power and authority likely reflected the emergence of discussion
around the new policies enforced by government officials and public agencies. As the death toll raised steadily—
hitting the mark of 1,000 deaths on March 26th—expressions of conflict faded away, and words of sadness became
predominant. In those days of hardship, a sentiment of care for others and expressions of prosocial behavior became
more frequent (+19% and +25%, respectively). Last, mentions of work-related activities peaked as many people
either lost their job, or were compelled to work from home as result of the lockdown.
Thematic analysis. The language categories capture broad concepts related to Strong’s epidemic psychology
theory, but they do not allow for an analysis of the fine-grained topics within each category. To study them,
for each of the 87 combinations of language category and phase (29 language categories, for 3 phases), we listed
the 100 most retweeted tweets (e.g., most popular tweets containing anxiety posted in the refusal phase). To
identify overarching themes, we followed two steps that are commonly adopted in thematic analysis [Braun and
Clarke, 2006, Smith and Shinebourne, 2012]. We first applied open coding to identify key concepts that emerged
across multiple tweets; specifically, one of the authors read all the tweets and marked them with keywords that
reflected the key concepts expressed in the text. We then used axial coding to identify relationships between the
most frequent keywords to summarize them in semantically cohesive themes. Themes were reviewed in a recursive
manner rather than linear, by re-evaluating and adjusting them as new tweets were parsed. Table 2 summarizes
the most recurring themes, together with some of their representative tweets. In the refusal phase, statements of
skepticism were re-tweeted widely (Table 2, row 1). The epidemic was frequently depicted as a “foreign” problem
(r. 2) and all activities kept business as usual (r. 3).
In the anger phase, the discussion was characterized by outrage against three main categories: foreigners—especially
Chinese individuals, as Supplementary Materials detail—(r. 4), political opponents (r. 5), and people who adopted
different behavioral responses to the outbreak (r. 6). This level of conflict corroborates Strong’s postulate of the
“war against each other”. Science and religion were two prominent topics of discussion. A lively debate raged
around the validity of scientists’ recommendations (r. 7). Some social groups put their hopes on God rather than
on science (r. 8). Mentions of people self-isolating at home became very frequent, and highlighted the contrast
between judicious individuals and careless crowds (r. 9).
Finally, during the acceptance phase, the outburst of anger gave in to the sorrow caused by the mourning of
thousands of people (r. 10). By accepting the real threat of the virus, our Twitter users were more open to find
collective solutions to the problem and overcome fear with hope (r. 11). Although the positive attitude towards
the authorities seemed prevalent, some users expressed disappointment against the restrictions imposed (r. 12).
Those who were isolated at home started imagining a life beyond the isolation, especially in relation to reopening
businesses (r. 13).
Comparison with other behavioral markers. To assess the validity of our approach, we compared the previous
results with the output of alternative text-mining techniques applied to the same data (internal validity), and with
real-world mobility traces (external validity).
Comparison with other text mining techniques. We processed the very same social media posts with three alternative
text-mining techniques (Figure 1 E-G). In Table 4, we reported the three language categories with the strongest
correlations with each behavioral marker.
First, to allow for interpretable and explainable results, we applied a simple word-matching method that relies on
a custom lexicon containing three categories of words reflecting consumption of alcohol, physical exercising, and
economic concerns, as those aspects have been found to characterize the COVID-19 pandemic [The Economist,
2020]. We measured the daily fraction of users mentioning words in each of those categories (Figure 1 E). In the
refusal phase, the frequency of any of these words did not significantly increase. In the anger phase, the frequency
of words related to economy peaked, and that related to alcohol consumption peaked shortly after that. Table 4
shows that economy-related words were highly correlated with the use of anxiety words (r = 0.73), which is in
line with studies indicating that the degree of apprehension for the declining economy was comparable to that of
health-hazard concerns [Fetzer et al., 2020, Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2020]. Words of alcohol consumption were most
correlated with the language dimensions of body (r = 0.70), feel (r = 0.62), home (r = 0.58); in the period were
health concerns were at their peak, home isolation caused a rising tide of alcohol use [Da et al., 2020, Finlay and
Gilmore, 2020]. Finally, in the acceptance phase, the frequency of words related to physical exercise was significant;10 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER

this happened at the same time when the use of positive words expressing togetherness was at its highest—affiliation
(r = 0.95), posemo (r = 0.93), we (r = 0.92). All these results match our previous interpretations of the peaks for
our language categories.
Second, since it is unclear whether a simple word count approach is effective in studying how the three psychosocial epidemics unfolded over time, we additionally applied the deep-learning approach that extracts mentions of
expressions of conflict, social support, and power. Figure 1 F shows the min-max normalized scores of the fraction
of users posting tweets labeled with each of these three interaction types (as per Formula 5). In the refusal phase,
conflict increased—this is when anxiety and blaming foreigners were recurring themes in Twitter. In the anger
phase, conflict peaked (similar to anxiety words, r = 0.88), yet, since the first lock-down measures were announced,
initial expressions of power and of social support gradually increased as well. Finally, in the acceptance phase,
social support peaked. Support was most correlated with the categories of affiliation (r = 0.98), positive emotions
(r = 0.96), and we (r = 0.94) (Table 4); power was most correlated with prosocial (r = 0.95), care (r = 0.94), and
authority (r = 0.94). Again, our previous interpretations concerning the existence of a phase of conflict followed by a
phase of social support were further confirmed by the deep-learning tool, which, as opposed to our dictionary-based
approaches, does not rely on word matching.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 11

Third, we used the deep-learning tool that extracts mentions of medical entities from text [Scepanovic et al., 2020].
Out of all the entities extracted, we focused on the 100 most frequently mentioned and grouped them into two
families of symptoms, respectively, those related to physical health (e.g., “fever”, “cough”, “sick”) and those related
to mental health (e.g., “depression”, “stress”) [Brooks et al., 2020]. The min-max normalized fractions of users
posting tweets containing mentions of these symptoms (as per Formula 7) are shown in Figure 1 G. In refusal phase,
the frequency of symptom mentions did not change. In the anger phase, instead, physical symptoms started to be
mentioned, and they were correlated with the language categories expressing panic and physical health concerns—
swear (r = 0.83), feel (r = 0.77), and negate (r = 0.67). In the acceptance phase, mentions of mental symptoms
became most frequent. Interestingly, mental symptoms peaked when the Twitter discourse was characterized by
positive feelings and prosocial interactions—affiliation (r = 0.91), we (r = 0.88), and posemo (r = 0.85); this is
in line with recent studies that found that the psychological toll of COVID-19 has similar traits to post-traumatic
stress disorders and its symptoms might lag several weeks from the period of initial panic and forced isolation [Galea
et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2020, Dutheil et al., 2020].
Comparison with mobility traces. To test for the external validity of our language categories, we compared their
temporal trends with the mobility data from Foursquare. We picked three venue categories: Grocery shops, Travel
& Transport, and Outdoors & Recreation to reflect three different types of fundamental human needs [Maslow,
1943]: the primary need of getting food supplies, the secondary need of moving around freely (or to limit mobility
for safety), and the higher-level need of being entertained. In Figure 1 H, we show the min-max normalized number
of visits over time (as per Formula 9). The periods of higher variations of the normalized number of visits match the
transitions between the three phases. In the refusal phase, mobility patterns did not change. In the anger phase,
instead, travel started to drop, and grocery shopping peaked, supporting the interpretation of a phase characterized
by a wave of panic-induced stockpiling and a compulsion to save oneself—it co-occurred with the peak of use of
the pronoun I (r = 0.80)—rather than helping others. Finally, in the acceptance phase, the panic around grocery
shopping faded away, and the number of visits to parks and outdoor spaces increased.
Embedding epidemic psychology in real-time models. To embed our operationalization of epidemic psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological models, urban mobility models), our measures need to work at
any point in time during a new pandemic; yet, given their current definitions, they do not: that is because they are
normalized values over the whole period of study (Figure 1 A-C). To fix that, we designed a new composite measure
that does not rely on full temporal knowledge, and a corresponding detection method that determines which of the
three phases one is in at any given point in time.
First, for each language category c, we computed the average value of fc (as per Formula 1) during the first day of
the epidemic, specifically µ[0,1](fc). During the first day, 86k users tweeted. We experimented with longer periods
(up to a week and 0.4M users), and obtained qualitatively similar results. We used the averages computed on this
initial period as reference values for later measurements. The assumption behind this approach is that the modeler
would know the set of relevant hashtags in the initial stages of the pandemic, which is reasonable considering that
this was the case for all the major pandemics occurred in the last decade [Fu et al., 2016, Oyeyemi et al., 2014,
Chew and Eysenbach, 2010]. Starting from the second day, we then calculated the percent change of the fc values
compared to the reference values:
(12) ∆%c(t) = fc(t) − µ[0,1](fc)
µ[0,1](fc)
.
For each phase, we defined a parsimonious measure composed only of two dimensions: the dimension most positively
associated with the phase (expressed in percent change) minus that most negatively associated with it (e.g., (death
- I) for the refusal phase). To identify such dimensions, we trained three logistic regression binary classifiers (one
per phase). For each phase, we marked with label 1 all the days that were included in that phase and with 0 those
that were not. Then, we trained a classifier to estimate the probability Pphasei
(t) that day t belongs to phase i, out12 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER

of the ∆%c(t) values for all categories. During training, the logistic regression learned coefficients for each of the
categories. On average, the classifiers were able to identify the correct phase for 98% of the days.
The regressions coefficients were then used to rank the language category by their predictive power. Table 3 shows
the top three positive beta coefficients and bottom three negative ones for each of the three phases. The top
and bottom categories of all phases belong to the LIWC lexicon. For each phase, we subtracted the top category
from the bottom category without considering their beta coefficients, as these would require, again, full temporal
knowledge:
∆%Refusal = ∆%death − ∆%I
∆%Anger = ∆%swear − ∆%death
∆%Acceptance = ∆%sad − ∆%anxiety
(13)
The resulting composite measure has the same change-points (Figure 3A) as the full-knowledge measure’s (Figure 1),
suggesting that the real-time and parsimonious computation does not compromise the original trends. In a real-time
scenario, transition between phases are captured by the changes of the dominant measure; for example, when the
refusal curve is overtaken by the anger curve. In addition, we correlated the composite measures with each of the
behavioral markers we used for validation (Figure 1 E-H) to find which are the markers most typically associated
with each of the phases. We reported the correlations in Table 4. During the refusal phase, conflictual interactions
were frequent (r = 0.58) and long-range mobility was common (r = 0.62); during the anger phase, as mobility
reduced [Engle et al., 2020, Gao et al., 2020], some people hoarded groceries and alcohol [Da et al., 2020, Finlay and
Gilmore, 2020] and expressed concerns for their physical health (r = 0.81) and for the economy [Fetzer et al., 2020,
Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2020]; last, during the acceptance phase, some people ventured outdoors, started exercising
more, and expressed a stronger will to support each other (r = 0.90), in the wake of a rising tide of deaths and
mental health symptoms (r = 0.85) [Galea et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2020, Dutheil et al., 2020].
Language use after the first contagion wave. After the first wave and the “stay-at-home” lock-down at the
end of March, for the remaining part of the year, there were two other contagion waves (Figure 2A): one at the
beginning of June, and the other at the beginning of October. In a way similar to the first wave, these two othersHOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 13

were both associated with significant changes in the use of language (Figure 2B): we had two change peaks for the
second wave (i.e., May 27th and June 9th), and one for the third (October 2). This comes at no surprise as these two
periods corresponded to two widely discussed events: the first 100K deaths in the U.S., and President Donald Trump
testing positive for COVID-19. In particular, Figure 3B shows that these changes were both to do with the rumping
up of the categories associated with the anger phase: discussions of changes in mobility, and posts characterized
by anger and, more generally, by negative emotions were predominant. By contrast, the categories associated with
refusal and acceptance diverged from each other: unsurprisingly, throughout the year, refusal gradually died off,
while acceptance increasingly took hold. Overall, we observed two classes of pattern (Figure 3B). First, the three
phases were not always orthogonal but blended together at times. During the second contagion wave, for example,
anger and acceptance were both predominant, and had been so for several months. Second, the use of language
had a cyclical nature. During each contagion wave, three consecutive local peaks (local maxima) were observed:
refusal first, then anger, finally acceptance. This can be observed for all the three contagion waves. Such a cyclical
nature was also reflected in our behavioral markers (Figure 4(E-H)). For each wave, mentions of conflict peaked to
then be followed by mentions of support and power (Figure 4F). The same went for medical conditions: mentions
of physical health peaked to then be followed by mentions of mental health (Figure 4G).14 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER

Discussion
Findings beyond Strong’s model. Strong’s theory offers a framework upon which to operationalize the three
psycho-social epidemics from the use of language but does not specifically describe how these epidemics unfold.
Based on our data-driven results, we confirmed that the three epidemics are indeed present in our social conversations
spanning almost one year, and they unfolded in ways that allowed us to enrich what Strong initially hypothesized
in relation to four main aspects.
First, Strong’s theory predicts the presence of the three psycho-social epidemics but does not describe how they
would be related to each other over time. We found that the three epidemics, as expressed by the relative presence
of their relevant language categories, simultaneously raised and fell over time, and did so in relation to one another,
demarcating three specific temporal phases. Over time, we identified three specific combinations of the epidemics
that generated three phases our Twitter users went through: an initial refusal phase, an anger phase, and a final
acceptance phase. Since these temporal phases partly resemble the stages of grief by K¨ubler-Ross et al. [1972], a
promising direction for future work is to explore the relationship between these phases and the stages of grief.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER 15
Second, Strong’s narration slightly hints at a typical sequence of events according to which the epidemic of fear
activates before that of morality, which is then followed by that of action. We indeed observed a similar set of
events yet these events were not strictly sequential but rather cyclical. Interestingly, every new cycle started in
conjunction with the same specific event: the diffusion rate of the virus reaching a local maximum. Shortly after
every sharp increase in the diffusion rate, a cycle of refusal, anger, and acceptance unfolded among our Twitter
users.
Third, Strong’s framework does not make any explicit distinction between the initial stages of an epidemic and its
final stages. We found two regimes that considerably separated the initial stages from the later stages: in the initial
cycle, the variation of the three epidemics was of a larger magnitude than those in the two subsequent cycles.
Last, Strong’s theory should be used as a descriptive framework and, as such, cannot be used to explore short-term
variations. By contrast, a data-driven experimental work such as ours is able to point out when such variations
potentially took place, as Figure 4 shows. In future work, these points of change could be subject to qualitative
inquiry, which might well enrich the original formulation of the theory.
Implications. New infectious diseases break out abruptly, and public health agencies try to rely on detailed
planning yet often find themselves to improvise around their playbook. They are constantly confronting not only
the health epidemic but also the three psycho-social epidemics. Measuring the effects of epidemics on societal
dynamics and population mental health has been an open research problem for a long time, and multidisciplinary
approaches have been called for [Holmes et al., 2020]. We contributed to this line of research by operationalizing
Strong’s model and successfully testing it on Twitter in the U.S.. Since our methodology can be applied to any
textual data, future work may well study alternative (even cross-cultural) population segments. Since our language
categories are not tailored to a specific epidemic (e.g., they do not reflect any specific symptom an epidemic is
associated with), our approach can be applied to a future epidemic, provided that the set of relevant hashtags
associated with the epidemic is known; this is a reasonable assumption to make though, considering that the
consensus on Twitter hashtags is reached quickly [Baronchelli, 2018], and that several epidemics that occurred in
the last decade sparked discussions on Twitter since their early days [Fu et al., 2016, Oyeyemi et al., 2014, Chew
and Eysenbach, 2010].
Our method complements the numerous cross-sectional studies on the psychological impact of health epidemics
conducted on representative population samples [Shultz et al., 2015, Brooks et al., 2020], not least because it
collects real-time statistics of implicit behavioral signals, which are orthogonal to survey responses.
For computer science researchers, our method could provide a starting point for developing more sophisticated
tools for monitoring psycho-social epidemics. Furthermore, from the theoretical standpoint, our work provides the
first operationalization of Strong’s model of the epidemic psychology, and widens its theoretical implications by
observing cyclical phases of diffusion of the psycho-social epidemics.
Finally, the ability to systematically characterize the three psycho-social epidemics from the use of language on
social media makes it possible to embed epidemic psychology into models currently used to tackle epidemics such as
mobility models [Bansal et al., 2016]. To see how, consider that, in digital epidemiology [Salathe et al., 2012, Bauch
and Galvani, 2013], some parameters of epidemic models are initialized or adjusted based on a variety of digital
data to account for co-determinants of the spreading process that are hard to quantify with traditional data sources,
especially in the first stages of the outbreak. This is particularly useful when modeling social and psychological
processes such as risk perception [Bagnoli et al., 2007, Moinet et al., 2018]. Interestingly, these approaches are
designed to deal with partial data, therefore they can benefit even from digital data that is incomplete and—like in
the case of our Twitter-based study—not necessarily representative of the whole population [Salathe et al., 2012].
Limitations. Future work could improve our work in five main aspects. First, we focused only on one viral
epidemic, without being able to compare it to others. Yet, if one were to obtain past social media data during
the outbreaks of diseases like Zika [Fu et al., 2016], Ebola [Oyeyemi et al., 2014], and the H1N1 influenza [Chew
and Eysenbach, 2010], one could apply our methodology in those contexts as well, and identify similarities and
differences. For example, one could study how mortality rates or speed of spreading influence the representation of
Strong’s epidemic psychology on social media.
Second, our geographical focus was the entire United States and, as such, was coarse and limited in scope. In
Supplementary Materials, we broke-down the analysis of temporal phases for individual states in the U.S., and
observed no substantial differences across states. In the future, one could conduct a more systematic analysis on
a finer geographical granularity, relate differences between states to known events (e.g., a governor’s decisions,16 HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER
prevalence of cases, media landscape, and residents’ cultural traits). In particular, recent studies suggested that
the public reaction to COVID-19 varied across the U.S. states depending on their political leaning [Painter and
Qiu, 2020, Grossman et al., 2020]. One could also apply our methodology to other English-speaking countries, to
investigate how cultural dimensions [Hofstede et al., 2005] and cross-cultural personality trait variations [Bleidorn
et al., 2013] might influence the three psycho-social epidemics.
Third, the three psycho-social epidemics were not always orthogonal to each other but did blend together at times.
Future work could focus on those particular periods of time to determine whether the use either of finer-grained
categorizations of language or of event detection techniques other than our change-point detection [Aiello et al.,
2013] could disentangle those periods in theoretically meaningful ways.
Fourth, our study is limited to Twitter, mainly because Twitter is the largest open stream of real-time social media
data. The practice of using Twitter as a way of modeling the psychological state of a country carries its own
limitations. Despite having a rather high penetration in the U.S. (around 20% of adults, according to the latest
estimates [Perrin and Anderson]), its user base is not representative of the general population [Li et al., 2013].
Additionally, Twitter is notoriously populated by bots [Ferrara et al., 2016, Varol et al., 2017], automated accounts
that are often used to amplify specific topics or view points. Bots played an important role to steer the discussion
on several events of broad public interest [Bessi and Ferrara, 2016, Broniatowski et al., 2018], and it is reasonable to
expect that they have a role in COVID-related discussions too, as some studies seem to suggest [Yang et al., 2020].
To partly discount their impact, since they tend to have anomalous levels of activity (especially retweeting [Bessi
and Ferrara, 2016]), we performed two tests. First, we computed all our measures at user-level rather than tweetlevel, which counter anomalous levels of activity. Second, we replicated our temporal analysis excluding retweets,
and obtained very similar results. In the future, one could attempt to adapt our framework to different sources of
online data, for example to web search queries—which have proven useful to identify different phases of the public
reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic [Husnayain et al., 2020].
Last, as Strong himself acknowledged in his seminal paper: “any sharp separation between different types of epidemic
psychology is a dubious business.” Our work has operationalized each psycho-social epidemic independently. In the
future, modeling the relationships among the three epidemics might identify hitherto hidden emergent properties.

Spatial representativeness of Twitter data. To make sure that the geographical penetration of our Twitter
data reflects the spatial distribution of the U.S. population, we compared the user activity in each state with
the census population. Figure S1 shows that both the number of Twitter users and the volume of their tweets
correlate very strongly with the census population population estimates in year 2019 at the level of US states
(https://www.census.gov).

Figure S1. Correlation of the census population of US states estimated in year 2019 with: the
number of tweets posted in those states (left), and the number of unique Twitter users who posted
at least one tweet (right) during the period of analysis. A linear fit is shown together with the
coefficient of determination for a linear regression (R2
), the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and
the coefficient of the fit (β). The number of tweets and that of Twitter users scale almost linearly
with population estimates.
Signals of racism in Twitter discussions. To corroborate the qualitative intuition that the first phase was
characterized by discussions that depicted the pandemic as a foreign problem, often using racist undertones, we
measured the volume of tweets containing hashtags that were clear indicators of content that is either racist or
aimed at antagonizing China. We manually selected those hashtags from the list of hashtags that appeared at
least 100 times in the dataset. Figure S2 shows the min-max normalized volume of those hashtags over time; they
peak during the first phase, when fear-related mentions and the focus of Twitter discussions on China and Asian
foreigners were at their peaks.
Breakdown of phases by state. During the period of analysis, the country was fragmented into regions that
were dealing with different stages of the outbreak, and the policies to contrast it varied across states. To assess
whether those differences impacted the unfolding of the psycho-social epidemics across states, we computed the
measures that represent the relative presence of the three phases over time (∆%Refusal, ∆%Anger, ∆%Acceptance)
for each state individually. The results are shown in Figure S3. Despite minor differences, the state-level curves
indicate that: i) the three phases took place in all states; ii) the sequence of the phases is consistent across states
(refusal is followed by anger, which is then followed by acceptance); and iii) there is very little variation of the
times of transition between phases.HOW EPIDEMIC PSYCHOLOGY WORKS ON TWITTER
